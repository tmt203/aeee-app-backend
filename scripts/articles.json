		"Abstract": "Sound source localization is essential in many areas such as robotics interaction, teleconferencing, sound extraction and recognition, noise cancellation in vehicles, object location detection, assessment of noise pollution in living spaces, and search and rescue. Interaction in natural settings requires the detection of different sources of sounds from the environment. Accurately detecting and differentiating incoming sound directions always attracts attention and has been researched using various methods. However, most of these methods still require complex algorithms or large amounts of calculations, which are accompanied by the cost of hardware and system resources. In this paper, we present a novel method and metrics for estimating the direction of multiple sound sources based on a combination of beamforming, time difference of arrival (TDOA), and frequency sparsity. Our new proposals are well-suited for deployment on resource-limited devices, offering reduced processing complexity, short computation time, and real-time response.",

		"Abstract": "This article proposes an integrated approach combining a novel population-based jellyfish search algorithm (JSA) and loss sensitivity factor (LSF) to optimize single and multiple distributed generation (DG) placement and ratings for total active power loss (TAPL) minimization and total voltage deviation (TVD) reduction. The study considers photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine (WT) DG systems for optimal integration. The simulation findings are examined for a single and multiple DG allocation on the IEEE 69-bus benchmark radial distribution power network (RDPN). The TAPL of the 69-bus benchmark RDPN is minimized from 225 kW to 77.10 kW, 62.32 kW, 19.52 kW, and 9.94 kW after the single PV, three PV, single WT, and three WT DG systems optimization, respectively. Simultaneously, the TVD is minimized from 1.8369 per unit (p.u.) to 0.7036 p.u. and 0.6698 p.u. for a single and three PV DG systems optimization, respectively, and 0.3934 p.u. and 0.3466 p.u. for a single and three WT DG systems placement, respectively. The performance of the proposed integrated approach is compared to the different optimization techniques, taking TAPL as a comparison metric. The comparison showcases that the integrated approach results in a favorable optimal solution among the compared optimization techniques.",

		"Abstract": "Technology in robotics is continuously advancing, supported by developments in electronics and control systems. Consequently, robots are increasingly used to serve human needs. A critical component in the movement of a robot is the arm, which functions as the primary manipulator. However, existing methods are suboptimal for controlling robot arms, especially in object manipulation and real-time control. Therefore, this study developed a robotic arm system for a five-degree-of-freedom service robot using the type-2 fuzzy logic method, designed to perform tasks such as gripping and moving objects automatically. The type2 fuzzy logic system takes two inputs: Y-coordinates of the bounding box for object detection and depth estimation, with the output being the movement of the robot arm. Simulation results indicate that type-2 fuzzy logic with a seven-membership function performed better than type-1 fuzzy logic, achieving a steady-state error of 0,1342. In real-time testing, the service robot arm, using type-2 fuzzy logic with a seven-membership configuration, gripped and moved an empty bottle in 45 s and the filled bottle in 48 s. The robot arm successfully executed a handshake with a human in real time within 30 s. These findings validate the effectiveness of the robot arm with type-2 fuzzy logic.",

		"Abstract": "Advancements in ultra-wideband reconfigurable band-pass filters (BPF) with notch band function are required for modern communication systems operating across a broad frequency spectrum. This paper introduces an innovative design of a reconfigurable UWB BPF with notch functionality covering two separate operating states: 1st operating frequency band of 3.7 GHz \u2013 13 GHz with good insertion and return losses, at approximately 0.9 dB/58 dB respectively, and the 2nd operating frequency band from 2.7 GHz to 15 GHz incorporating 5.1 GHz \u2013 5.3 GHz notch band with insertion and return losses of 1.3 dB/57 dB respectively, using PIN/Varactor switches. Subsequently, a notch filter is strategically integrated into the design to suppress unwanted frequencies, enhancing the filter\u2019s selectivity and interference rejection capabilities. An experimental prototype for the reconfigurable filter with PIN diodes was fabricated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed design, demonstrating its suitability for UWB communication applications. Notably, the filter exhibits UWB characteristics, with a broad passband covering a wide frequency range with notch filtering to attenuate interfering signals. The compact size of the filter design 23.4 mm \u00d7 8.7 mm ensures practical integration into communication systems.",

		"Abstract": "Backscatter communication (BackCom) is an emerging technology that enables ultra-low-power wireless transmission by reflecting ambient signals. To enhance spectral efficiency and improve communication performance, we integrate BackCom with partial nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In this paper, we propose a partial NOMA-assisted backscatter communication system for device-to-device (D2D) networks, where a backscatter device (BD) reflects signals from a source to two users via distinct channels. We derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP) of both users under Rayleigh fading and various decoding conditions. The analytical results provide insights into the impact of key system parameters, such as the reflection coefficient, power allocation factors, and channel conditions, on the system\u2019s reliability. In particular, by adjusting the bandwidth allocation coefficient, we are able to compare the system performance between partial NOMA and full NOMA schemes.

		"Abstract": "This paper investigates the physical-layer secure performance of a multi-power beacon-empowered wirelessly powered communication system in the surveillance of an external eavesdropper. Specifically, a limited-energy source harvests energy from multiple dedicated power beacons in the first time slot and reuses it to perform data transmission in the second time slot. However, its communication with the destination is wiretapped by a potentially idle untrusted user. Thus, to evaluate the secure performance of the considered system, we have derived closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) metric in terms of both exact and asymptotic aspects. Through these formulas, we then provide a series of numerical discussions on how to configure the number setting of the power beacon, the energy harvesting parameters as well as scheduling time to improve the SOP performance, where the Monte-Carlo simulation method is used to verify the developed mathematical framework.",

The equations of the hydraulic subsystem are formed based on the principle of electrohydrodynamic analogy and reflect the physical processes in its components. The parameters of the centrifugal pump model were calculated based on the geometry and dimensions of its internal elements, taking into account the influence of the physical properties of the working fluid. It makes it possible to conduct a comprehensive study of such objects without physical impact on them, taking into account the mutual dependence of both subsystems and changes in the parameters of the elements of the hydraulic subsystem.

		"Abstract": "IEEE 802.11ah is designed to enhance IoT networks by supporting numerous stations, extending coverage range, reducing power consumption, and operating within the sub-1 GHz band. The Restricted Access Window is introduced to mitigate collisions and improve network throughput when multiple stations contend for the channel simultaneously. While the PHY layer in IEEE 802.11ah supports multiple channels with different bandwidths, the MAC layer only supports a single channel for communication between the Access Point (AP) and stations. However, network performance can be improved by enabling stations at different locations to exchange data packets on different channels concurrently. This paper proposes a Spatial Multi-channel MAC (SM-MAC) protocol for IEEE 802.11ah, which divides the AP\u2019s coverage area into sectors, each assigned a dedicated channel. Each sector is served by two Forwarders responsible for relaying data packets between stations and the AP. The performance of the SM-MAC protocol is evaluated against the IEEE 802.11ah MAC protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput, and energy efficiency.",

		"Abstract": "Logistics is a challenge in military as things are fluid and on the move constantly 24 X 7. Managing inventory for weapon systems, vehicle parts, ammunition, food items, utensils, clothing and other day-today necessary items is cumbersome and needs a professional solution incorporating the geographical challenges faced by military. Supply chain in military is done manually and thus prone to errors due to poor inventory management and manual documentation. This paper brings a green solution to this problem with minimum resource requirement and maximum coverage, also keeping in mind the remote area challenges such as power and weather conditions. Backscatter radios communicate by means of reflections without any batteries; rather they generate energy from ambient electromagnetic waves through energy harvesting. Multistatic scatter network uses carrier emitters and readers to gather information from hundreds of tags placed on different set of items spread over a large area. This data generated by reader from tags in a warehouse can automate the inventory management and lead to smart logistics system for military cargo facilities. This paper proposes a multi-static topology for large warehouses with non-linear energy harvesting for effective coverage of cargo facility. Paper also gives an insight on information and energy outage in small-scale fading scenarios. Comparison with linear energy harvesting and mono-static model is also carried out and substantiated by simulations.",

		"Abstract": "Interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) have been used extensively in the transportation, industrial, medical, and military fields recently because of their many benefits, including high power density, high torque, and high operational economy. However, current studies have mainly focused on using traditional windings for these motors, neglecting the potential improvements in motor performance that could be achieved with different winding types. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the performance of these motors when using different winding structures. This paper presents a combination of analytical technique and finite element method to compare the electromagnetic parameters (back electromotive force (EMF), output power and torque, and temperature rise) of IPMSMs with conventional and hairpin winding configurations. The validated method is then applied to a practical V-shape IPMSM with conventional and hairpin winding configurations.",

		"Abstract": "The growing use of advanced equipment in modern systems, such as electronic devices and drives, has led to a decline in power quality (PQ), causing malfunctions in sensitive loads. Additionally, the integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid significantly impacts the PQ of the electrical system. To address these effects on voltage stability and harmonic distortion, the unified power flow controller (UPFC) series compensator has proven to be a highly effective solution. This study focuses on using the UPFC to mitigate PQ issues related to renewables, including voltage sag, swell, harmonics, and fault conditions. The UPFC is controlled by a fractional order proportional integral derivative (FOPID) controller, which uses the improved zebra optimization algorithm (ZOA) to determine optimal gain values under various PQ scenarios. Furthermore, three comparative assessments of different optimization approaches are conducted to achieve the desired performance and power of the proposed UPFC. The results showed that the proposed ZOA approach compared with WOA and PSO yielded the shortest computing time of 173.554, 257.544, and 382.405 seconds and achieved an objective function value of 2.371, 2.387, and 2.398, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated using the MATLAB/Simulink platform, with results showing significant improvements in voltage stability and harmonic reduction.",

		"Abstract": "In this study, we present the design of an automatic food supply system for dairy cows using an expert calculation formula based on collected data, including temperature and humidity of the barns, cow movement, daily milk production, the breeds and ages of the herd. When the expert system calculates the amount of the total mixed ration (TMR) feed to provide to the cows, it will transfer the TMR value to the proposed system to provide the exact amount of the daily feed. The designed feeding system performs 3 tasks: 1) Accurately quantify the amount of the TMR feed ingredients according to the formula including chopped grass and fine feed portions; 2) Mixing the measured ingredients during a preset time from the system; 3) Transporting the feed after mixing to the feeding trough for dairy cows and then automatically retrieving the leftover feed. The proposed system was tested at the Tan Tai Loc dairy cow farm, Soc Trang City, Vietnam. The results show that the automatic weighing system can reach \u00b10.5% accuracy, and the proposed feeding system can minimize feed loss and eliminate overfeeding to promote good cow health and performance.",

		"Abstract": "Induction motor bearing fault diagnosis stands as a crucial aspect of rotating machinery maintenance. Numerous studies have delved into employing current signals and machine learning methods for this purpose. However, the effectiveness of these approaches relied heavily on manually selecting features for training. Moreover, traditional machine learning techniques struggle with large volumes of computational data. To address these limitations, researchers have turned to deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet, and AlexNet, either individually or in combination with traditional machine learning methods, for bearing fault diagnosis. Published convolutional neural network-based works usually use basic CNN networks. The experimental data are time or frequency domain data, and the fault classification accuracy is high only with noise-free signals. This paper proposes a novel approach aimed to enhance the accuracy of bearing fault identification by leveraging a CNN model trained on both the estimated motor current signals and their corresponding Fast Fourier Transform values. Comparative analysis against existing methodologies including machine learning and single-input convolutional neural networks or multiinput convolutional neural networks demonstrates that the proposed method achieves impressive results. The bearing fault accuracy reaches up to 99.88% for noisefree signals and 99.14% for signals with added noise at a Signal-to-Noise Ratio of -10 dB.",

		"Abstract": "The wind power plant designs are different from the design of other conventional power plants such as hydropower plants, thermal power plants, and nuclear power plants because the input fuel of these types of power plants is controllable. Wind power plants depend on the speed of wind energy. Therefore, the problem of optimizing the location of turbines in a wind farm to achieve maximum annual energy output (AEP) is of great interest. In this paper, the Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS) algorithm is proposed to optimize the arrangement of turbines in the wind farm to minimize the wake effect so that the wind farm achieves the maximum generating capacity and the highest power factor (CF). SFS represents a significant advancement in optimization techniques, offering robust, adaptable, and efficient solutions to complex problems like wind farm layout optimization. Its innovative use of fractional dynamics and stochastic processes distinguishes it from traditional methods, providing superior performance in many scenarios. The proposed method was tested on a standard case with three types of turbines with different capacities of 850kW, 1000kW, and 1500kW to confirm the suitability of the algorithm and select the most appropriate turbine type. The results of AEP and wake loss calculated by the SFS algorithm were superior compared to those obtained by the PSO algorithm for these three turbine types. The turbine with the highest CF will be selected for application in the wind farm. Therefore, the proposed SFS algorithm can be a potential method to deal with the problem of optimization of wind farm layout.",

		"Abstract": "This paper deals with implementing artificial neural networks for the identification and control Investigating the stability and stabilization of a single machine connected to an infinite bus through a transmission line (SMIB) system. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) employs a multi-layer feedforward network trained using the Backpropagation (BP) algorithm by simulations using MATLAB/Simulink. Weight coefficients of the ANN are determined using the LevenbergMarquardt algorithm. The proposed approach uses two types of neural networks: neural controller and neural identification, neural network control is a single device on an infinite bus instead of the PID-PSS controller, to improve the performance of the SMIB system, and neural identification to emulate the characteristics of the single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system These neural networks model system dynamics and nonlinear for selection and control purposes. The primary objective is to develop a neuronal identification model that accurately equals the characteristics of the single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system and a neuro-controller is implemented to replace traditional controllers such as Power System Stabilizers (PSS) and Automatic Voltage Regulators (AVR). Simulations are performed to examine the system under various conditions, evaluating rotor speed deviation, stator voltage, and rotor angle delta.",

		"Abstract": "The concept of Virtual Power Plant (VPP) emerges as a pivotal advancement in power systems engineering, aiming to enhance the integration of renewable energy sources into the power market. This research delves into the challenges faced by Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), such as power losses, voltage variations, and revenue losses in the distribution network, hindering the effective participation of small-scale renewable energy sources in the power market. Furthermore, the research addresses the challenge of poor dynamic response in VPPs attributed to dynamic loads and DER characteristics. To mitigate this, a Proportional Resonant (PR) controller is proposed to enhance the dynamic performance of the VPP. Comparative analysis with the conventional Fractional Order Proportional Integral Derivative (FOPID) controller reveals the superiority of the PR controller. The PR-controlled VPP exhibits improved dynamic performance with a lower settling time of 0.49 seconds and a reduced steady-state error of 2.78 compared to the FOPID controller. The investigations extend to the comparison of voltage, real power, and reactive power between the FOPID and PR controllers. The results underscore the superior response of the PR-controlled VPP, showcasing its efficacy in achieving faster responses and minimizing spikes in voltage and power variables.",

		"Abstract": "The irregular generation patterns of renewable energy systems lead to undesirable fluctuations in power grids. Integrating energy storage facilities into renewable energy systems is proposed as a solution to this issue. In this study, a photovoltaic energy system with energy storage is designed, and the effects of deterministic and stochastic optimisation-based algorithms on maximum power point tracking are analysed to ensure high-efficiency operation. In the designed system, maximum power point tracking of the photovoltaic system is achieved using the conventional Perturb and Observe, Incremental Conductance, Fuzzy Logic-Based Perturb and Observe, and Particle Swarm Optimization. The algorithms are extensively compared based on performance metrics such as rise time, settling time, and overshoot rate. The Fuzzy Logic-Based Perturb and Observe algorithm exhibits the best performance, with a rise time of 14.28 milliseconds and a settling time of 51.6 milliseconds, achieving the highest efficiency with a battery state of charge level of 69.97%. Detailed simulation analyses conducted in the Matlab/Simulink environment reveal that the fuzzy logicbased method provides faster and more stable results than other methods. Furthermore, a 24-hour real solar irradiance dataset is utilised to test the model under realistic environmental conditions, allowing for a more reliable evaluation of the performance of our storageintegrated photovoltaic.",

		"Abstract": "This research presents different implementations for placing electric charging stations (ECSs) in distribution power networks (DPNs) to achieve the best total active power loss (TAPL). Solar generators (SGs) are also used to alleviate the adverse effects resulting from the presence of ECSs in the networks in terms of power loss and voltage profile. Artificial hummingbird algorithm (AHA), Jellyfish swarm algorithms (JS), and Northern goshawk optimization (NGO) are executed to determine the best placement of ECSs and SGs in an IEEE 33-node network for reaching a minimum loss and satisfying all the related constraints. There are four cases conducted in the whole research. In the first case, JS outperforms both AHA and NGO by providing the highest stability throughout all the trial runs and fastest convergence speed to the optimal solution in the best runs. Besides, the quantitative comparison also consolidates the robustness and reliability of JS compared to others. Based on the surprising performance, JS is continuously reapplied to solve another three cases of the considered problem. Through those three cases with the application of JS, the TAPL values of four scenarios with different numbers of ECSs are evaluated. Specifically, the results achieved by JS indicate that the higher number of ECSs leads to a higher value of TAPL and a higher voltage drop. On the other hand, the simultaneous placement of SGs and ECSs can result in smaller fluctuations of the voltage profile and smaller TAPL. Thus, the optimization placement of ECSs and SGs is crucial to DPNs for economic and technical purposes.",

		"Abstract": "Solar energy is a favored renewable energy source in the energy sector due to its zero emissions, environmental friendliness, low cost, and sustainability. However, meteorological factors such as weather conditions and cloud movements can interrupt solar radiation, potentially leading to undesirable outcomes in the energy sector. Solar irradiance forecasting is crucial for mitigating these adverse effects and supporting the development of renewable energy projects. In this study, the methods employed in the literature for various prediction intervals are classified, and the evaluation results of these predictions are summarized in a table. Also, an example model created with ANFIS for estimating solar radiation is presented. Imagebased and NWP models is perform well for short-term forecast horizons. To predict various time horizons, artificial intelligence-based models such as time series models, deep learning, and machine learning are prefer. Hybrid models that combine multiple methods to achieve higher accuracy are also proposed, although this increases the complexity and cost of the model. There are potential limitations in the field of solar forecasting that arise from model and data characteristics. Therefore, This study aims to guide other researchers in this field by discussing the features, limitations, and results of the models used for solar forecasting. Also, the example of daily solar radiation forecasting provided in this study offers a practical application opportunity for researchers new to this field.",

		"Abstract": "This paper evaluates outage performance of wireless energy harvesting-assisted multi-hop mobileto-mobile schemes. In our scheme, a mobile source sends its data to a mobile destination via a preestablished route, utilizing multiple intermediate mobile relays. The source and relay nodes harvest energy from a power beacon station deployed in the network, and they use this energy to transmit the data. To enhance reliability of data transmission, cooperative communication is employed at each hop, with assistance of outer mobile nodes (they are not on the source-todestination route). An incremental cooperation technique is applied at each hop, i.e., cooperative communication is only performed when the direct link is outage. Moreover, two partial relay selection algorithms are also considered at each hop. This paper calculates end-to-end outage probability of the proposed schemes over double-Rayleigh fading channels. The obtained results show that our schemes can achieve better outage performance, as compared with the conventional multihop relay scheme and a corresponding scheme that uses random relay selection at each hop.",

		"Abstract": "This paper deals with the design of a suitable, transparent, and reasonably accurate methodology for the economic evaluation of household photovoltaic (PV) installations in the Czech Republic. The basis of economic evaluations of household photovoltaic installations is a time model of energy balance from which cash flows result. Therefore, a specific methodology of the energy balance calculation is proposed to increase accuracy, while at the same time, reasonably increasing the energy balance model complexity by using the Monte Carlo method (probability model). Following the detailed analysis of the affecting factors and the compilation of the methodology for the energy balance calculation, the main stochastic parameters were specified. These specified stochastic parameters are estimated by the Monte Carlo method in multiple scenarios. The presented methodology of the energy balance calculation is also used for direct calculation where the mean values of the same specified stochastic parameters (without assumption of their probability) serve as the reference values for one scenario. Pros and cons of the designed methodology are demonstrated in a case study of an existing household photovoltaic installation. The mean values of the output parameters from the Monte Carlo method scenarios are then calculated for subsequent results comparison of both methods and also with the real (measured) values of the case study installation. Then a cash flows for each year of the installation\u2019s lifetime are stated, and the internal rate of return (IRR) as an economic evaluation criterion is calculated. The results show that IRR differs between methods by about 2.5% which may be crucial in such long-term projects on the verge of profitability. The accuracy of the application of the Monte Carlo method to the output parameters is then discussed in the conclusion where some possible recommendations for further work and project evaluators are indicated as well.",

		"Abstract": "The exact evaluation of breast cancer images for patients is very important, because they can be early treated for lasting their life. This article proposes a classification system for finding breast cancer images, in which each breast lesion image is segmented to produce a largest Region of Interest (ROI) and a VGG16 deep learning network is applied for classification. An Otsu threshold is utilized on two datasets from two sources of CBIS-DDSM and MIAS to create largest ROI with main features. For the classification with high performance, two datasets of the breast lesions were augmented by rotating, flipping, and brightness variation. This article was proposed an algorithm with processing images sets before classification using VGG16. In particular, the results of the largest ROI datasets for four types of breast lesions were represented through segmentation, normalization and enhancement. In addition, the results of classifying four types of breast lesions (BC, BM, MC, MM) were evaluated using confusion matrix, with the high accuracy of around 95%. Another evaluation was that these image sets without ROI/with ROI parts/With the largest ROI only using the Otsu segmentation were compared and the highest accuracy was of the image sets with the largest ROI. The results with the high accuracy demonstrated to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It means that this method can be developed to classify many stages of breast cancers during diagnosis and treatment.",

		"Abstract": "The grounding grid of a power system is very important for absorbing the harmful overvoltages and/or overcurrents during transients. The lightning surges frequently causes overvoltages and/or overcurrents via the grounding grid. This may have dangerous effects on persons and/or equipment. Therefore, this paper reviews in detail the transient in grounding grids due to lightning surges. The grounding grid configurations and mathematical modeling are explained. Many configurations are used in the analysis such as one, four, sixteen meshes grounding configurations. Also, two injection points are analyzed: at the terminal and the middle of the grid. The analysis is carried out using ATP/EMTP. Many transient responses of voltages and currents at different points of the grounding grid for different configurations are calculated and compared. The peak voltage and current values are compared to be the basis of safety design of the grounding system.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, we addressed improving the physical layer security (PLS) of an energy harvesting (EH)-based wireless network composed of a source node, which is operated by the harvested energy from the power beacon and sends secure information to a destination in the presence of an eavesdropper and a cooperative jammer (CJ). In particular, we provided an explicit transmit design for minimizing the secrecy outage probability (SOP), subject to a minimum secrecy rate constraint. The results show that support from a friendly jammer can significantly improve the reliability and security performance of the system. Additionally, we described the effects of particular factors on the optimal possible temporal distribution between information transmission and energy harvesting. As a result, when considering the SOP, we concluded that there exists an optimal value of the time switching factor for the system to function well.

		"Abstract": "This article introduces a novel method for choosing the optimal solution from the Pareto front generated by the multi-objective harmony search (MOHS) algorithm, specifically aimed at optimizing an induction motor. We formulate both single- and multi-objective optimization problems that minimize active mass while maximizing efficiency and rated torque. To effectively identify and manage the Pareto-optimal front, we utilize non-dominated elitist fast sorting and crowding distance. Comprehensive simulations using MATLAB software were conducted on a 18.5 kW, 4- pole, 50 Hz squirrel-cage induction motor serving as our test system. Furthermore, in-depth comparisons were made between our proposed method and established approaches like the fuzzy membership approach and the geometric mean, all vying to select the best solution from the Pareto set generated by the Harmony search algorithm. This rigorous evaluation highlighted the superior efficiency and robustness of our method, demonstrating significant improvements compared to the motor\u2019s initial values: 0.4377% for rated torque, 0.1766% for efficiency, and a remarkable 7.1048% for active mass.",

		"Abstract": "Renewable sources offer benefits including more efficient power system operation and management and reduction of CO2. Recent increases in distributed generation cause operational and technical challenges such as voltage rise. Hosting capacity aims to estimate how much additional generation can be integrated into the existing network without breaching prescribed technical and operational constraints. The aim of this paper is to explore in the recent literature answers to questions: how HC can be calculated, what factors influence it and how it can be improved. The most common HC improvement methods are photovoltaic inverter reactive power control, voltage control, network reconfiguration and soft open points usage, conductor reinforcement and classical reconstruction of the network, active operational strategies based on control of the active and reactive power, active power curtailment, battery energy storage systems, power quality improvement and electrical vehicles. To achieve advantages like reducing calculation time and improving accuracy, state-of-the-art research enhancements are built on a unique combination of techniques from earlier studies. They take into account both technological and economical constraints, in comparison to earlier approaches where only technological constraints were considered. It also aims to present what are the major contributions in the field, what are the existing research gaps, opportunities and possible future directions. This paper contributes as it presents the state of art in this field and gathers information that can be used as a foundation for future research. It can be concluded that this remains an important area of research with numerous research opportunities.",

		"Abstract": "The rapid expansion of power transmission infrastructure necessitates the development of efficient and accurate inspection methods. This paper proposes an autonomous positioning model for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that can detect power line insulators on transmission lines to address this need. The proposed model leverages machine learning algorithms for autonomous detection of insulators. To determine the optimal stopping point and safety distance between the UAV and the insulator, a mathematical model is presented that utilises the captured images and the machine learning algorithm. A simulation model is utilised to verify the proposed model, ensuring that the UAV moves to the best-predicted position. The machine learning algorithms are utilised to identify and calculate the length of power line insulators. A set of labelled insulator images is trained in the selected machine learning algorithm, enabling it to accurately determine the length of insulators in new images. The mathematical model considers the size of the insulator in the image to calculate the safety distance between the UAV and the power line insulator, while also determining the optimal image shooting coordinate. MATLAB\u2019s Simulink software is utilised to leverage the UAV\u2019s navigation and control systems, enabling it to move to the best position for capturing high-quality photos of the power transmission lines. The model also considers environmental conditions and operational constraints for optimisation. The proposed autonomous positioning model has undergone extensive simulation to demonstrate its effectiveness. Furthermore, the autonomous positioning of the UAV reduces human intervention, minimises inspection time, and increases efficiency and cost-effectiveness.",

		"Abstract": "Cable-driven robotic arms (CDRA) are robots with novel structures, wherein flexible cables are used to drive rigid links identified to move the end effector according to a desired trajectory. Due to the complex and nonlinear characteristics of this type of robotic arm, it is challenging to derive the model, which requires critical analysis to be conducted. This paper presents the design, modeling, and Model Predictive Control (MPC) of a special 2D CDRA with four rigid links. Maplesim is employed as a tool to design and simulate the proposed robotic arm. First, the prototype model is constructed in Maplesim and simulated using random input signals, and the input and output data sets are collected. A data-driven scheme based on neural networks is used to learn the unknown kinematics of the CDRA and to solve the kinematic control issue. The Matlab-Simulink platform is used for this purpose, and the black box model is obtained using the neural network fitting tool. MPC is then used for the end effector trajectory tracking control and to validate the modeling processes. Furthermore, comparative simulations using two scenarios are applied to the controlled system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control method with the aid of Mean Squared Error (MSE) as an optimality index. The result verified that CDRA is capable of following reference trajectories accurately with MSE of 10e-5 and 4.99e-5 for rhombus and circular trajectories respectively.",

		"Abstract": "This paper deals with an independent control of two parallel-connected five-phase induction machines (FPIM) fed by NPC three-level inverter. In effect a direct torque control (DTC) of two parallelconnected FPIMs has been developed to ensure a simple and fast decoupled control over the stator flux and electromagnetic torque and high performance in event of machine parameters disturbances. However, DTC suffer from the torque and flux ripples due the hysteresis controllers. In this context, an intelligent DTC based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been proposed to minimize the stator flux and electromagnetic torque ripples in a steady and transient states and therefore reduction of the stator current harmonic THD. hence, Intelligent ANN hysteresis controllers and switching table of the DTC have been incorporated to select the optimum voltage vector of the NPC-VSI to be applied in the control of two parallel-connected FPIM. Moreover, a virtual current sensor (VCS) approach is proposed to configure a fault-tolerant control scheme (FTC). The effectiveness of the proposed (DTC-ANN) and the FTC have been checked by an intensive simulation in different operating conditions.",

		"Abstract": "The effectiveness of a Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) operating in a single-phase configuration controlled using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) depends on multiple factors, particularly a special attention given to the Delay Time (DT) linked to the switching of power devices within the same arm. The ramifications of DT in a single-phase VSI have notable effects on output quality, harmonic content, and transient responsiveness. In this paper, a DT compensator is implemented for a single-phase VSI using the Average Based Pulse Compensation (ABPC) method. This technique adjusts switching instant to counteract the effects of DT and mitigate voltage distortions, reduce harmonic content, and enhance waveform quality. Simulations and validations are performed using MATLAB/Simulink to evaluate compensator performance under different operating conditions. The compensator design is implemented in hardware through the utilization of an FPGA SPARTAN 6 XC6SLX9 controller, tasked with generating a PWM pulse. The quality of ouput voltage and current has been improved by ABP compensation and the THD is reduced by 20%. Additionally, a laboratory testing phase is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method, involving the validation of a prototype for a single-phase PWM inverter.",

		"Abstract": "The Earth's population has grown from a hyperbolic rate to a slower one, reaching 8.04 billion in 2023. The growth rate has dropped from 2% to 0.84% per year, due to lower birthrates, COVID-19, urbanization and income levels. The number of elderly people has surpassed the number of young children. The text discusses how the increasing and aging population requires better health care and diagnosis, which can be achieved by using modern technologies like the Internet of Things, smart city, and 5G. This causes an increase in the level of electromagnetic radiation, which is concerning because of the electromagnetic sensitivity of medical devices and systems.  This article discusses how electromagnetic interference (EMI) affect medical devices and systems in hospitals and healthcare environments. It explains what EMI are, how it can cause problems for medical devices and systems such as pacemakers, defibrillators, neurostimulators, etc., what are the main sources of EMI such as emergency radios, diathermy, mobile phones, RFID devices, electromagnets, etc., and how to prevent or minimize such risks. Discusses 5G mobile communication, which is becoming increasingly popular, especially the n77 3.7 GHz 5G band as reported by Opensignal recently. However, in urban settings, especially in the medical campus area, a major challenge is the level of electromagnetic interference, which can adversely affect the performance of sensitive medical devices/equipment. The use of the proposed antenna array can help to reduce these challenges by using the beam scanning technique. Design a 7-by-7 rectangular array of antenna elements with 0.5*lambda spacing on a PCB using the Phased Array System Toolbox. Align the array normal with the same-parallel direction to create a maximum coverage area in the geographic azimuth, where single antenna element type is dipole antenna element with a reflector.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents a new structure of an Orthogonal Signal Generator for a Phase Locked Loop (OSG-PLL), utilizing an Adaptive Notch Filter (ANF) in bandwidth as the foundation. The ANF employed to generate the orthogonal system within the Phase Locked Loop (PLL), is implemented from the parallel configuration of several Bandpass Filters (BPF), starting from a lattice-structured All-Pass Filter (APF). This approach offers benefits such as simplicity and reduced sensitivity to coefficient rounding in fixed-point Digital Signal Processor (DSP) implementations. The bandwidth changes adaptively by adjusting and achieving the optimization of the filter coefficients. Two adaptation algorithms are proposed, studied, and analyzed, one utilizing Gradient Descent (GD) and another based on Proportional Control of Maximum Error (ME). A series of comparative simulations are conducted using MATLAB software to validate the most effective method among the two described algorithms. The simulation results from MATLAB and the experimental results from a fixed-point digital signal processor (DSP), specifically the TMS320F812, are showcased and examined to assess the effectiveness of the algorithm of proportional control of the ME, which has been selected as the superior alternative, thereby supporting its theoretical development.",

		"Abstract": "By 2050, the global population is expected to exceed 9.7 billion, increasing the demand for food production. Traditional farming operations cannot supply the exponential food demand due to land, water, and resource limits. Vertical hydroponic (VHF) systems, which enable hydroponically growing plants in space-constrained situations such as high-rise buildings and inside structures, could be a promising solution to these difficulties. Furthermore, smart technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and autonomous control systems (ACS) can be used to improve the efficiency and productivity of these systems. The combination of IoT and ACS in VHF can give several advantages, including increased efficiency, productivity, and sustainability. Nonetheless, there are challenges and limitations associated with the application of these systems. Thus, this research presented a thorough examination of the function of IoT and ACS in VHF. This paper also explored the benefits and obstacles of deploying these systems, as well as future research opportunities in this field. Finally, this article demonstrated how IoT and ACS have the potential to change agriculture and handle the growing demand for food production in a sustainable manner",

The three algorithms were used on a photovoltaic energy conversion system that was linked to a grid. The suggested methodologies investigate the photovoltaic (PV) system's solar energy conversion performance under various irradiance and temperature circumstances. Lastly, a performance comparison between IC , P O, and FLC has been performed, demonstrating the superiority of the fuzzy controller over the other approaches. FLC converts photovoltaic electricity readily, reducing fluctuations, and it responds quickly to variations in solar irradiation (shading effect). The simulation results demonstrate that the controller using fuzzy logic performs well, allowing the inverter to convert  electricity provided by the solar panels.",

		"Abstract": "Permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) have gained many interests in various industrial applications due to its high efficiency, reliable perfaromance, simple structure and various shapes and sizes. In addition, due to the high-torque and low-speed, the PMSM has a wide usage in traction applications, e.g. trucks, ship propulsion, mining, etc. So far, many papers working on three phase PMSMs have been published. But, to improve the fault tolerance and reliability of three-phase PMSM, the six-phase motors has been proposed to use  in applications demanding high reliability. However, there are still significant limitations in the quantity of research on this motor type. Particularly, when researching this type of motor, authors mainly have provided  specifications of six-phase PMSMs and then conducted experiments on these machines without giving  the detailed formulations to compute and analyse electromagnetic parameters of six-phase PMSMs.  In this research, an analytic model is first developed to determine the main parameters of the a six-phase surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor (SPMSM). The finite element method (FEM) is then introduced to simulate and compute electromagnetic parameters, such as the current waveform, back EMF, flux density distribution, torque, cogging torque, torque ripple and harmonic components. The development of the proposed methods is applied on the practical problem of a six-phase PMSM of 7.5kW.",

		"Abstract": "In this research, the system is designed to monitor parameters of residential solar power sources such as voltage, current, power capacity, power factor and energy consumption. These parameters are measured by a highly accurate PZEM circuit and the specifications are suitable for residential solar power sources. Measurement results will be sent to the main control circuit (ARM controller) via the UART communication standard to analyze and filter the necessary data. The data of that parameter will then be displayed at the system installation site using the TFT screen. After an installation period, the control circuit will send measurement parameters to the dedicated WiFi module (ESP32), the WiFi module will continue to send parameters to the cloud server for storage and monitoring. The system also builds applications that run on many operating systems, can access data, and display data in real time using IoT technology. From the results, evaluating the performance and stability of the solar power source is done simply and easily, helping users detect and promptly handle incidents that occur, as well as such as providing maintenance plans to ensure the most optimal operation of solar power sources. In addition, the designed system also has the function of remotely controlling on/off the solar power supply to the loads when an incident occurs, ensuring safety for the electrical system.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents a study of a robust control strategy based on the Attractive Ellipsoid Method (AEM) to achieve trajectory tracking for a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG).  For the PMSG system, trajectory tracking control is necessary such that the maximum power point tracking can be carried out, which depends on controlling time-varying references (the generator angular speed), mainly when the generator motion is originated from a variable and intermittent energy source such as the wind. The proposed controller is based on the selection of the best gain matrix by numerically employing the AEM with the bilinear matrix inequality technique application.The controller guarantees that the trajectory tracking error reaches an ellipsoid of small enough size, which is determined in an optimized way, such that the practical stability for the tracking error is ensured. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified via simulations for a PMSG coupled with a three-phase rectifier, where the variables to be controlled reach the desired time-varying references, additionally a comparison is made against a classical Proportional Integral (PI) control scheme and a state feedback LQR controller.",

		"Abstract": "Ferroresonance is an oscillation in a nonlinear circuit containing transformers at light load or no load coupled with a capacitor. The non-linear behavior of the core material of the transformer at no load is represented by a nonlinear equation. The capacitive effects of the power network are treated as a capacitor in series with the transformer equivalent circuit. As the system contains a nonlinear equation, it was difficult to analyze the model using the linear method. The finite Element Method is used here for the simulations of ferroresonance. The Finite Element Method allows a field solution to be obtained, even with time-varying fields with non-homogeneous or non-linear fields. This method helps to find out the changes that occur in the magnetic structure of the core under ferroresonance. Supply voltage is taken as the variable parameter. Capacitor and transformer voltages along with the phase plane are analyzed before and after the occurrence of ferroresonance over-voltage. Distribution and change in the magnetic flux during the triggering of ferroresonance are also examined.",

		"Abstract": "When a high magnitude of current is discharged to the ground, a large potential gradient will result in a ground potential rise (GPR, or induced voltage. This GPR usually decreases with distances, depending on the soil resistivity, ground electrode sizes, configurations and steady state resistanceRDC values. The GPR value not only provides an information on the safe distance of the nearby equipment to the grounded electrical systems subjected to impulse conditions, but can also identify the right rating of the equipment, particularly sensitive electronic equipment, that are in a vicinity of the ground installations.  Further, during the high voltage testing on the ground electrodes at field sites, the results may also be influenced by the electrodes under tests, which can cause inaccuracy in the measurements. This paper is therefore aimed to measure the GPR, where the measured results are still found to be limited in literature, for various soil resistivity and ground electrodes. The measured GPR values are obtained by injecting high magnitudes of impulse current of both impulse polarities on the ground electrode, and the voltage magnitudes at distances away from the edge of the electrode under impulse are measured. The measurements of GPR allows the investigations on the effect of impulse polarity on these GPR values, which cannot be obtained by computational method.",

		"Abstract": "This study presents a strategy to stop paying monthly used energy costs for households in Vietnam\u2019s cities and towns. To get there, the total energy cost acquired from the utility grid must equal the total extra energy supplied to the grid. In addition to the power consumption reduction from the grid for household customers, the extra energy produced by the rooftop photovoltaic system (RPV) is sold back to the grid. This mechanism has effectively freed up the monthly energy bill for individual customers. However, the optimal rated power of the rooftop photovoltaic system (RPV) must first be determined. Two meta-heuristic algorithms, including the Coati optimization algorithm (COA) and the Osprey optimization algorithm (OOA), are implemented to solve the problem. The results obtained by the two algorithms are compared using different criteria. Through these comparisons, OOA completely outperforms COA regarding solution quality and stabilization. For instance, OOA is the only method to reach the best optimal rated power of the RPV. Moreover, OOA is also more effective than COA with 50.17\\% on mean cost, 11.49\\% on maximum cost, and 17.06\\% on standard deviation.  By using the solution found by OOA, RPV not only fulfills the household's needs but also reduces the electric energy cost to zero. While evaluating a five-year operation period, the household can get the benefit of \\$3,635.64. So, using the RPV is very effective for reaching both economic and environmental benefits.",

		"Abstract": "Multilevel inverters (MLIs) are attracting the attention of academics as well as industry as a feasible technology for an extensive variety of purposes, like renewable energy sources, and Electric vehicles. MLIs are commonly employed as a part of the sophisticated converter configurations in both high and medium voltage applications. The creation of minimised switch MLI structures remains a key objective of the present research with the goal to achieve superior results despite of involved a greater number of switches. Basically, various layouts of asymmetrical configuration using enhanced cascaded bridge topologies are identified in a brief overview and evaluated against important parameters. It is a method of designing multiple voltage levels using identical switch count and fewer devices. This work describes numerous varieties of harmonic mitigation techniques, and it also outlines the most effective switching angle optimizations to produce various levels. Furthermore, the effectiveness of configuration is evaluated based on minimising THD due to decreasing lower order harmonics. THD is evaluated against various mitigation techniques employing certain proportions of source voltages coming from solar energy /batteries. THD is calculated theoretically and contrasted to simulation outcomes for the suggested configurations. The simulated waveforms of various configurations are examined using Hardware in loop (HIL) application.",

		"Abstract": "{{This paper presents the nonlinear system identification methodology on the Modified magnetic levitation model (MLM). The proposed modification of the original CE 152 MLM replaces the outdated MF624 laboratory card with the Board51. This modification enables the integration of the MLM into the Distributed Control Systems (DCS) architecture and moves the control loop closer to the system. The integration into the DCS architecture requires a detailed description of the system, which along with well-known physics laws is used by the analytical identification method to derive a mathematical model. The method of experimental identification is used to estimate all four unknown parameter values of the derived mathematical model. Parameters are estimated in the structure of output prediction error using the nonlinear least squares method. The resulting gray-box model is used to design a stabilizing optimal state control algorithm (LQI). This control algorithm is used for indirect validation of the identified model by comparing the outputs of the real and simulation models in a closed-loop setup. The validated model can be used as the basis for the creation of the digital twin.",

		"Abstract": "Facial emotion recognition has gained attention of researchers all over the world in the past few decades. Initially, emotions were classified in the seven basic categories which included happy, sad, angry, etc. However, human emotions are rarely this simple. They are usually combinations of dominant and complimentary emotions and are known as Compound Emotions. Two different ways have been commonly adapted for the recognition of these emotions from facial images: firstly, by using handcrafted features, or by using deep learning networks. This research analyzes the performance of a much simpler designed deep learning model named as Sequential-Convolution Neural Network (S-CNN) and four predefined deep learning networks for the recognition of compound emotions from facial images. The objective of this paper is to replace sophisticated state-of-the-art prediction models with a straightforward but effective approach. Therefore, this research suggests a hybrid network that maintains the S-CNN model's design simplicity while boosting performance. The features extracted by the S-CNN model and the handcrafted features are combined in the hybrid S-CNN model. This process keeps the hybrid model's architecture simple while improving its metrics values and increasing its accuracy to 99.62\\% when compared to other state-of-the-art models. \\\\The source code for this research can be found in our GitHub repository: \\href{https://github.com/CompoundEmotion-Recognition/SCNN_Hybrid_model",

		"Abstract": "This paper studied the physical layer security (PLS) reliability of concurrent wireless communications. A decode and forward (DF) full-duplex (FD) network with the impact of an eavesdropper was proposed to evaluate the security and reliability. Essentially, the DF-FD relay adopted the power-splitting (PS) protocol to gather energy from the source and simultaneously utilized the self-energy recycling (S-ER) technique by manipulating the loopback interference to increase the harvested energy. By constructing closed-form expressions for outage probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP), we offer the trade-off analysis between them. Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to verify the analytical formulations. Furthermore, the key parameters were also examined to play an important role in selecting the suitable trade-off for the proposed system.",

		"Abstract": "This paper proposes and studies performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multi-hop schemes employing short packet communication (SPC). In the proposed schemes, a source sends its data to a destination, and one RIS is deployed to assist the data transmission at each hop. For complexity reduction purposes, we propose two RIS-assisted data transmission methods at each hop. In the first one, the RIS is only used when the quality of the direct link is not good. In the second one, the direct link or the relay link via the RIS is selected for the data transmission. We evaluate performance of the two proposed schemes by deriving formulas of end-to-end block error rate (BLER-e2e) over Rayleigh fading channel. Finally, the derived BLER-e2e expressions are validated by computer simulations.",

		"Abstract": "This article proposes and introduces a smart parking system using RFID technology incorporating a Deep Learning model to identify license plates. It tries to simulate the ability of the brain to recognize, differentiate and learn patterns from data. The employed algorithms are mainly based on neural network models where neurons are organized in stacked layers. The system is designed to manage incoming and outgoing vehicles by collecting and processing images and data on passenger information to update parking status with the news of empty lots. Another function of the parking system also designed is a fully automatic method of paying the parking fee by the user. The deep learning model for the smart parking system is implemented using the Raspberry PI 3 embedded system and sensors. Experimental results with the plate identification rate in the worst condition, up to 80\\%, have proven the reliability of the proposed smart parking system. In terms of quantity, the percentage of the worst plate identification down to 10\\% has established the stability of the proposed smart parking system.",

		"Abstract": "Smart Grids (SG) encompass the utilization of large-scale data, advanced communication infrastructure, and enhanced efficiency in the management of electricity demand, distribution, and productivity through the application of machine learning techniques. The utilization of machine learning facilitates the creation and implementation of proactive and automated decision-making methods for smart grids.  In this paper, we provide an experimental study to understand the power demands of consumers (domestic and commercial) in SGs. The power demand source is considered a smart plug reading dataset. This dataset is large dataset and consists of more than 850 user plug readings. From the dataset, we have extracted two different user data. Additionally, their hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly power demand is analysed individually. Next, these power demand patterns are utilized as a time series problem and the data is transformed into 5 neighbour problems to predict the next hour, day, week, and month power demand. To learn from the transformed data, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Linear Regression (LR) ML algorithms are used. According to the conducted experiments, we found that ANN provides more accurate prediction than LR Additionally, we observe that the prediction of hourly demand is more accurate than the prediction of daily, weekly, and monthly demand. Additionally, the prediction of each kind of pattern needs an individually refined model for performing with better accuracy",

		"Abstract": "With the increasing adoption of solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems in several applications, reliability and service continuity are important challenges that need to be addressed. Power converters are vital components in solar PV systems and inverters tend to be the most likely devices of equipment to experience faults which usually occur in the switching devices. It is therefore critical to assess the functioning of the inverters and identify these faults in order to lower risks and the resulting financial losses. Open-circuit faults (OCF) are among the most common. This paper suggests a fuzzy-based fault detection approach for the T-Type inverter in grid connected PV system based on the diagnosis variables which are calculated using the average values of positive and the negative parts of the normalized output currents data. After that, these variables are analyzed using a fuzzy logic technique, The single, multiple power switch open circuit faults may all be detected and diagnosed utilizing this fuzzy-based fault diagnostic technique. The results of the simulation in MATLAB show that the proposed method can accurately identify and locate OCF the inverter switches.",

		"Abstract": "E-rickshaws are relatively new additions to India\u2019s public road transportation system, gaining popularity as a convenient and cost-effective means of commuting for fellow travelers. However, they do not come equipped with a regenerative braking system. This paper proposes a simple and cost-effective regenerative braking system for e-rickshaw motors, incorporating an energy management system based on the state of charge of the battery. The proposed system can function effectively even when the battery is fully or nearly fully charged. Additionally, it eliminates the need for any supplementary current or voltage sensors, significantly reducing the circuit's complexity and cost. To evaluate the system\u2019s performance under various traction conditions, simulations, and tests are conducted using the MATLAB/Simulink model. The results confirm the high capabilities of the proposed system. The functionality and effectiveness of the proposed regenerative braking system are validated through laboratory experiments conducted under various conditions, including different speeds and levels of braking force, on a prototype equipped with an e-rickshaw motor. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed regenerative braking system is successful in achieving its intended purpose, even with the fully charged battery, and without the need for any additional current sensors or voltage sensors. The proposed regenerative braking system not only enhances the efficiency and sustainability of e-rickshaws but also contributes to reducing overall energy consumption and environmental impact. As a result, this innovative solution holds great potential for widespread adoption in India\u2019s growing e-rickshaw industry.",

		"Abstract": "In recent years, the voltage differencing differential difference amplifier (VDDDA) has been used in various analog signal processing circuit designs. A second-order multifunction filter with multiple-inputs and single-output (MISO) voltage mode using VDDDA as active elements is proposed in this paper. The structure of the proposed filter comprises two VDDDAs, two grounded capacitors, and two resisters. The proposed filter has a cascadability feature in a voltage-mode system, producing voltage input and voltage output at high and low impedance ports, respectively. It can offer responses for all-pass (AP), band-reject (BR), band-pass (BP), low-pass (LP), and high-pass (HP) filters without additional inverting and double gain amplifiers, as well as the matching conditions. Choosing the appropriate input signals provides these five filter responses in the same circuit topology. With two VDDDAs, the bias currents can be utilized to electronically tune the natural frequency ($\\omega_0$) independently from the quality factor ($Q$). Experimental results using available commercial ICs have supported the theoretical expectations and confirmed the practical operation of the proposed multifunction biquad filter.",

Specifically, a source node transmits data to the destination node using the power beacon's harvested energy in order to overcome the limited energy budget. Besides, an eavesdropper located in the proximal region of a source is trying to overhear secure information. Notably, both eavesdropper and destination are affected by co-channel interferences from other sources when they utilize the same frequency. By considering the above discussions, we derived the closed-form expressions for outage probability (OP), intercept probability (IP), and secrecy outage probability (SOP) in connection with using the system model. The derived analytical expressions are then verified by utilizing both simulation and numerical results. Finally, the intensive parameters' influences on the OP, IP, and SOP are also investigated.",

		"Abstract": "Agricultural sector has significant impact on the people health and on the economy of the world. Climate variation is important reason in causing plant diseases hence, affecting the estimated crop production. Prior detection of plant diseases is utmost important for improving the quality and quantity of production within the due course of time. In this paper, this challenge is addressed by automatically detecting tomato diseases from the hand-crafted features extracted from the plant leaves and machine learning classifiers. Different frequency bands are extracted using Gaussian filters and local statistics of leaves are captured using patterns to design frequency decomposed local ternary pattern (FDLTP). It provides a fast and accurate solution to avoid uncertainty in the farm production. Benchmarked dataset of Taiwan tomato leaves is used to verify the results. Performance of machine learning classifiers as well as deep learning solutions are compared, and 95.6\\% accuracy is obtained using proposed feature along with k-nearest neighbor classifier.

		"Abstract": "In the electric vehicle wireless power transfer (WPT) system, the mutual inductance coefficient (M) between the transmitting and receiving coils is an important factor influencing overall system efficiency. We reviewed a large number of research papers in this field but did not find a detailed analysis of the M. There are two contributions in this paper. First, the detailed mathematical model of the M was developed. Second, the three-dimensional spatial distribution diagram of the M was drawn using Python software, and the maximum value and its corresponding position coordinates were calculated. Then, the theoretical analysis of the M distribution in this paper was proven correct through experiments. The theoretical analysis and experimental verification of the M distribution in this paper provided a theoretical reference for the positioning requirements in the electric vehicle WPT system between the transmitting and receiving coils.",

		"Abstract": "Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) has been frequently utilized in wind turbines due to its ability to handle variable speed operations. This study investigates the real parameters of a Mitsubishi company MWT 92/2.4 MW wind turbine model. It performs and implements grid-connected variable speed turbines, to control the active and reactive powers. Moreover, it presents a vector control strategy of DFIG for controlling the generated stator power. Meanwhile, the rotor side converter (RSC) and grid side converter (GSC) are developed separately. Proportional-Integral (PI) controller and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm are implemented to regulate the generated torque, active or reactive powers, grid voltage, stator and rotor currents. In addition, MPPT and PI controllers are compared in terms of settling time. Thus, the result demonstrates that the performance of the MPPT technique provides strong robustness and reaches steady-state much faster than the PI controller with variable parameters. To the contrary, typical PI controller gives fast response in tracking the references of DFIG magnitudes. The effectiveness of the overall system is tested by MATLAB simulation.",

		"Abstract": "This study presents the application of Coot bird behavior-based optimization algorithm (COOTBA) for optimal placement of Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC) devices in an IEEE 30-node transmission power network with three single objectives, including fuel cost, power loss, and voltage deviation. COOTBA proves that TCSC is very useful for the power system to reduce cost and loss and improve the voltage of loads. COOTBA is implemented for the system with one case without TCSC devices and three others with TCSC. The results from the second case, only optimization of TCSC\u2019s reactance, have better cost and voltage but worse voltage stability than the first case without TCSC devices. For the third case, with optimization of both location and reactance of TCSC devices, the cost, loss, and voltage are better than in the first case but worse than in the fourth case. The third case limits the maximum reactance of TCSC within 0 and 0.02 pu, while the fourth case expands the range. The comparisons of results from COOTBA indicate that TCSC should be optimized for both location and reactance, and the limitation of TCSC devices should be high enough. In addition, COOTBA is also compared and superior to about fifteen other previous algorithms, including original, improved, and hybrid metaheuristic algorithms. Thus, COOTBA is an effective algorithm for optimizing TCSC devices on transmission power systems.",

		"Abstract": "A comparative study of undesirable effects of double stator switched-flux permanent magnet machine would be investigated, considering its rotor pole numbers. The predicted finite element analysis (FEA) machine parameters are: unbalanced magnetic force (UMF), total harmonic distortion (THD), torque ripple, cogging torque and static torque. It is revealed that the machine types that have odd number of rotor poles have lower undesirable machine properties such as: low cogging torque, low torque ripple and low total harmonic distortion compared to the ones that have even number of rotor poles; though, with higher amount of unbalanced magnetic force on the rotor. More so, the machine types having odd number of rotor poles would have higher air gap flux density magnitudes; and would also exhibit better average torque per magnet usage, which is desirable for reduced cost implications.",

		"Abstract": "Electromagnetic mechanisms are widely used in various systems due to the simplicity of their design and reliability in operation. One such system is the fuel injection system for an internal combustion engine. The electromagnets installed in such systems should have a number of special properties: they should have small dimensions, high speed, which is ensured by forcing, a small mass of moving elements, an increased residual air gap, a small armature stroke and minimal eddy currents in the magnetic core. The reduction of eddy currents is carried out through the use of steels with increased resistivity and special cuts in the housing and armature, which significantly complicates the design of the electromagnet, but is an effective method for reducing losses for DC electromagnetic systems. To assess the influence of the design of an electromagnet on its speed, the article present a comparative analysis of the solution of the problem of dynamics in a 3D formulation for a forced armored DC electromagnet and an improved electromagnet with reduced eddy current losses due to special structural cuts in the housing and armature.",

		"Abstract": "These Single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) has very low power consumption at the sender\u2019s side, and this is one of the potential candidates for uplink in long-term evolution (LTE). The objective of this work is to explore the error probability of SC-FDMA system under sub-carrier mapping in heavily faded areas where the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are very low. Wireless environment with heavily faded areas includes military radio systems; direct sequence spread spectrum system (DS-SS), global positioning system (GPS) etc. The localized FDMA (LFDMA) and distributed FDMA (DFDMA) are used to compare the performances of SC-FDMA in heavily faded areas. In heavily faded area with negative signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the SC-FDMA system is implemented using modulation and encoding methods to receive a very weak signal. Here, binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), 16-PSK, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and 16-QAM modulation techniques are used to calculate the bit error rate (BER) performances. The results show the BER performances of SC-FDMA using mapping schemes for different channels, like, AWGN channel, Rayleigh channel, COST207TU, and COST207RA channel models for heavily faded areas. In AWGN channel, BER at -15dB is about 10 times more than BER at 15dB. The COST207 model shows that the BER is less in typical urban (TU) area compared to the rural area (RA).The performance of BPSK modulation in SC-FDMA system is better in heavily faded areas than other modulation schemes.",

		"Abstract": "Frequency response analysis offers an insight about the integrity of machine windings, when employed as a tool for condition monitoring. To ensure that, an electromagnetic wave is injected from one terminal of winding, and the power of the wave at the receiving terminal is measured. The power at the terminals is measured in terms of either voltage or current. This difference in power at the two terminals can be attributed to the medium's permittivity, permeability and conductivity, through which the signal is being transmitted. This paper offers an explanation for the behavior of the voltage gain frequency response of induction motor winding and propagating medium parameters by employing the fundamental electromagnetic wave equations. Their explanation illustrates how these parameters can affect the response. The correlation established using Maxwell's equation and these parameters with frequency response analysis is evident while identifying open winding fault and issue with machine core inductance. The results are analyzed and interpreted with the new correlation.",

		"Abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is widely used for producing high quality imaging of Earth surface due to its capability of image acquisition in all-weather conditions. However, one limitation of SAR image is that image textures and fine details are usually contaminated with speckle noise. This noise is multiplicative and having granular pattern. It is caused due to the integration of various backscattered signals obtained during SAR image acquisition. It degrades the quality of SAR image and causes difficulty in visual interpretation. This paper presents a speckle reduction technique of SAR images based on statistical modelling of detail band shearlet coefficients (SC) in homomorphic environment. Modelling of SC obtained from log transformed noiseless SAR image are carried out as Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution. However, SC pertaining to speckle noise are modelled as Gaussian distribution. These SC are segmented as heterogeneous, strongly heterogeneous and homogeneous regions depending upon the local statistics of SAR image. Then maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is employed over the SC of all regions of detail bands that belong to homogenous and heterogenous category. Objective and subjective quality assessment is performed for synthetic images and real SAR images. Reference image quality metrics, PSNR and SSIM for synthetic images and non-reference image quality metrics, ENL for real SAR images signify the potential of proposed method in comparison to six existing image denoising methods.",

		"Abstract": "The new idea of this paper is to focus on investigating the influence of characteristics on the power and torque of an Interior Permanent Magnet (IPM) motor designed by the Tesla rear-drive. The detail of improvement designs of double V (2V) shape and inverter delta (VI) shape has been proposed for electric vehicles taking a high constant torque in a wide range speed into account. The torque ripple, output power and torque density are developed and evaluated in different topologies via the finite element method. The two-layered rotor structure with the 2V and VI shapes is also designed to give the suitable choices for manufacturing in mass production. For the higher torque density and efficiency, the two-layered 2V or VI magnets of IPM motor with 72 slots/8 poles can be adjusted with the sinusoidal step skewing to minimize the torque ripple, harmonic components and back electromotive force. The developed method is performed on the practical problem of the IPM motor of 200 kW-450 Nm, which is applied to the single drive system delivers.",

		"Abstract": "The purpose of this work is to develop proposals for modernizing the design of turbogenerators with a capacity of 200-300 MW in order to increase their power. To increase the power, it is proposed to increase the generator electromagnetic parameters (induction in the magnetic circuit and linear load of the generator). At the same time, the possibility of replacing hydrogen, which cools the generator internal volume, on the air was studied, which is a global trend for turbogenerators of thermal power plants with a capacity of 200-300 MW. A prerequisite was the preservation of the turbogenerator dimensions. The set goals were achieved by changing the geometry of the stator core tooth zone and intensifying cooling. To determine the necessary changes in the tooth zone with a change in the electromagnetic and thermal characteristics of the turbogenerator, a mathematical model was developed that makes it possible to determine by calculation the required dimensions and configuration of the stator slots and gas cooler elements at condition that the permissible thermal characteristics are maintained. The modelling of the stator core was carried out in order to select the dimensions of the slots and channels of axial ventilation for the required mode of the coolers operation, subject to an increase in power.",

		"Abstract": "Electric Vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity due to their low maintenance, better performance and zero carbon emission. To expand their adoption, Electric Vehicles Charging Stations (EVCS) must be integrated with the distribution system constructively to charge EVs. This study suggests an RAO-3 based on the fuzzy classification technique for the optimum EVCS, Distributed Generations (DGs), and Shunt Capacitors (SCs) sizing and positioning for 69 bus radial distribution systems with network reconfiguration. The proposed method has the following advantages (i) lower active power loss, (ii) enhanced voltage profiles, (iii) improved power factor at the substation, and (iv) optimum distribution of EVs at charging stations. Characteristic curves of Li-Ion battery charging are utilised for load flow analysis to build EV battery charging loads models. The proposed simultaneous fuzzy multi-objective study with a reconfigured network can handle the optimal number of EVs in EVCS and maintain the substation power factor at the required level, yielding an impressive distribution system performance. For example, the minimum active power loss of 18.0884 kW is achieved with a minimum voltage enhanced to 0.9905 p.u., maintaining the bus voltages at their permissible limit. The numerical results indicate that using the RAO-3 algorithm, the simultaneous technique with system reconfiguration is computationally efficient and scalable, outperforming the two-stage methodology and the method without system reconfiguration.",

		"Abstract": "A bidirectional DC-DC converter can diminish the uncertainty of PV generation and enhance system reliability when integrated with energy storage systems. Usually, a Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converter with soft switching capability essentially matches the needs of an energy storage system. The DAB not able to reduce the inductor current stress when load is increased, and thus, the efficiency is decreased. To address this issue, we present a novel Quadruple Active Bridge (QAB) converter. In terms of enhancing the efficiency along with mitigating the current stress on the Low Voltage (LV) side, the LLC resonant converter with a constant pulse width modulation scheme was implemented. Finally, the QAB-LLC converter fed with Electric Vehicle\u2019s (EV\u2019s) Battery has been verified in MATLAB/Simulink and it results in a maximum State of Charge (SOC) and, maximum voltage capability which provides a high efficiency along with minimum inductor current stress on LV side.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents an advanced control method for the stabilization of Electric power systems. This method is a decentralized control strategy based on a set of neural controllers. Essentially, the large-scale power system is decomposed into a set of subsystems in which each one is constituted by a single machine connected to a variable bus. For each subsystem, a neural controller is designed to respond to a performance index. The neural controller is a feed-forward multi-layered one. Its training method is accomplished for different rates of desired terminal voltage and is based on the perturbed electrical power system model. For a single machine, the synaptic weights of corresponding neural controller are adjusted to force the machine outputs to converge into expected one obtained by the load flow program. To evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed control method, it has been applied to the WSCC power system under severe operating conditions. The obtained results compared to the ones of conventional controllers proved the high quality of the proposed controller in terms of transient stability and voltage regulation of the considered electrical power system.",

		"Abstract": "Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) are preferred for realizing logic circuits at nanoscale dimensions along with a high level of integration and minimal energy consumption. Hamming code is a set of entropy codes used for error detection and correction in communication systems. Error detection and correction is carried out with the help of parity bits which are appended with the original bits. Designing a Hamming encoder in nanoscale has its own merits such as optimized area, reduced energy dissipation and lower QCA cost. This work proposes two QCA-based (7, 4) Hamming encoder designs; multilayer (proposed-1) and coplanar (proposed-2) structure with area and energy analysis. Proposed-1 encoder has achieved reduction of cell area by 12.5%, 34.58% in terms of cell count, and reduction in total energy dissipation of 26.8% when compared to reference encoder. Proposed-2 encoder has achieved reduction of 18.75% in area, 44.15% in terms of cell count, and 16.5% in total energy dissipation when compared to reference encoder. In terms of QCA cost, reduction of 12.5% is achieved in case of proposed structures. The energy dissipated in the proposed designs is less compared to reference encoder. Proposed-2 structure is more efficient compared to multilayer and reference encoder in terms of cell count, cell area and QCA cost. The QCA circuits are realized in QCADesigner and analyzed energy in QCADesigner-E.",

		"Abstract": "For a safe drive with a vehicle and better tyre life, it is important to regularly monitor the tyre damages to diagnose its condition and chose appropriate solution. This paper proposes a framework based on pattern recognition utilizing the strength of texture attributes and ensemble learning to detect the damages on the tyre surfaces. In this paper, a concatenation of the statistical and edge response based texture features derived from Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix and Local directional pattern are proposed to describe and represent the tyre surface characteristics and their variations due to any damages.  The derived features are provided to train machine learning algorithms using ensemble learning methods for a better understanding to discriminate the tyre surfaces into normal or damaged. The experiments of tyre surface classification were conducted on the tyre surface images acquired from Kaggle tyre dataset. The results demonstrated the ability of the combined texture features and ensemble learning methods in effectively analysing the tyre surfaces and discriminate them with better performance provided by adaboost and histogram gradient boosting methods.",

		"Abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to play a key role in the Sixth-Generation (6G) and Beyond Fifth-Generation (B5G) networks. Resolving spectrum constraints in UAV communications remains a critical issue. This article investigates Full-Duplex (FD) UAV-aided Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) to effectively utilise the scarce wireless spectrum. Specifically, exact closed-form formulas for the outage probability of FD UAV-aided NOMA have been developed. The results are validated using Monte Carlo simulation in 3GPP UMi conditions to provide practical guidelines for real-world deployment. In low transmission power regimes, the results also reveal that FD UAV-aided NOMA has a lower outage probability at the downlink Ground Users (GUs) than HD UAV-aided NOMA. At high transmit power regimes, FD UAV-aided NOMA is limited by residual SI at the UAV and interference from the UAV to the GUs. The numerical results also show that the transmission power at the UAV should be significantly lower than that at the Ground Base station (GB) to ensure low outages at the GUs.",

The proposed system is divided into several fundamental steps. The proposed classifier is trained to distinguish between incoming tumors using a dataset of 780 images. To evaluate the classifier's performance accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used.

		"Abstract": "The key task of computer vision is the recognition of visual objects in the analysed image. This paper proposes a method of searching for objects in an image, based on the identification of a cluster representation of the query descriptions and the current image of the window with the calculation of the relevance measure. The implementation of a cluster representation significantly increases the speed of identification or classification of visual objects while maintaining a sufficient level of accuracy. Based on the development of models for the analysis and processing of a set of descriptors of keypoints, we have obtained an effective method for the identification of visual objects. A comparative experiment with the traditional method has been conducted, where a linear search for the nearest descriptor was implemented for identification without using a cluster representation of the description. In the experiment, a speed gain for the developed method has been obtained in comparison with the traditional one by approximately 5.2 times with the same level of accuracy. The method can be used in applied tasks where the time of object identification is critical. The developed method can be applied to search for several objects of different classes. The effectiveness of the method can be increased by varying the values of its parameters and adapting to the characteristics of the data.",

		"Abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge imposed by the tremendous growth of digital data to retrieve relevant images. In this paper, a novel feature design methodology is proposed to represent images efficiently for Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR). Generally, local patterns are computed directly on images and hence, directional information of the images is ignored. In the proposed feature, Kirsch operators are used to highlight eight major directional changes in the image and further, Kirsch Ternary Local Pattern (KLTP) is extracted by analysing local intensity variations in the neighbourhood. In KLTP, global color information is also incorporated to make it robust and perform well on variety of images. Experiments on natural and texture databases are done to verify the performance, as compared to the available features in the literature.",

We attempted to detect the presence of fiber optic splitter-based eavesdropping points on the communication line by using common techniques designated for fiber optic quality measurement and fault detection. The results are summarised in this paper.",

		"Abstract": "A bandwidth efficient Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing - Radio over Free Space Optics (OFDM-RoFSO) system based on 2-level multiplexing with SCM and MDM domain is implemented. A total of 4-input data streams are multiplexed before being transmitted through RoFSO link. A 4 x 20 Gbps data rate is achieved by performing multiplexing at SCM level with 45 GHz, 60 GHz subcarrier frequencies and then at MDM level with HG01 and LG10 optical modes. With certain design enhancements, channel capacity can be further increased to multi-fold levels. The performance of transmitted input data streams 1-4 is investigated for Bit Error Rate (BER), Q-factor, received signal power, SNR and turbulence conditions under clear air, haze, rain, fog and dust conditions. Eye diagram and electric constellation patterns are analyzed for reliable data transmission. Thus, by using proposed design with 2-level multiplexing, a higher transmission capacity and low crosstalk levels are easily achieved.",

		"Abstract": "This paper aims to explore a viable monitoring and management of active and reactive powers for a large-scale wind farm based on Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIG) considering the voltage Fault-Ride-Through capability (FRT), especially Low-Voltage-Ride-Through (LVRT) capability by using a new control strategy, known as Active Disturbance Rejection Control. This strategy uses real-time estimation and compensation of the generalized \"total\" disturbance before it affects the system. The wind farm supervisory unit is used to coordinate the control of the powers production by the entire wind farm, which must take into account the couplings between each wind generator while producing the individual power commands. The turbine control units (local supervisory units) send the appropriate power references depending on the situation. This can be to produce the maximum power, to manage the active and reactive power given by the Transmission System Operator (TSO) or to meet the requirements of the grid code (LVRT capacity). However, to ensure the dispatching of the references of the active and reactive powers over the all wind generators of the wind farm and to satisfy the security of the power grid, we utilized mean of the proportional distribution algorithm. \r\nThe effectiveness of the proposed supervisory approach and control strategies are tested and validated through a multiples scenarios of simulations that are made under the MATLAB/Simulink Environment. The results obtained have demonstrated the efficiency and robustness of the control methods, and also the fact that they guarantee good performance and safety of the integration of wind farms into the grid while complying with the requirements of the grid code during power system faults.",

		"Abstract": "The tailpipe emission caused by the vehicles using internal combustion engines is a significant source of air pollution. To reduce the health hazards caused by air pollution, advanced countries are now adopting the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs). Due to the advancement of electric vehicles, research and development efforts are being made to improve the performance of EV motors. With a nominal reference stator flux, the classical induction motor drive generates significant flux, torque ripple, and current harmonics. In this work, a Teamwork Optimization Algorithm (TOA)-based optimal stator flux strategy is suggested for torque ripple reduction applied in a Classical Direct Torque Controlled Induction Motor (CDTC-IM) drive. The suggested algorithm's responsiveness is investigated under various steady-state and dynamic operating conditions. The proposed Direct Torque Controlled Induction Motor (DTC-IM) drive's simulation results are compared to those of the CDTC-IM and Fuzzy Direct Torque Controlled Induction Motor (FDTC-IM) drives. The proposed system has been evaluated and shown to have reduced torque ripple, flux ripple, current harmonics, and total energy consumption by the motor. Further, a comparative simulation study of the above methods at different standard drive cycles is presented. Experimental verification of the proposed algorithm using OPAL-RT is presented. The results represent the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to the CDTC- and FDTC-IM drive. The torque ripple reduction approach described in this study can also be applied to all types of induction motors, not only those for electric vehicles or Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs).",

		"Abstract": "This paper proposes the novel control strategy to improve the power quality injection of wind energy system using Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) into the grid by implementing artificial neural network. The torque ripple produced in DFIG due to loading by grid tied inverter, which leads to poor power quality injection into the system. Also, these ripples transferred by DC link and causes heating losses and generator phase current distortion. Therefore, this paper modelled ANN based control scheme to reduce the torque ripple content and restrict the transfer of ripple by DC link to improve the outcome of wind energy system while operating in variable conditions. The DFIG system under studied are modelled and simulated in MATLAB SIMULINK to verify the improvement using proposed control strategy. The recent control technique is also simulated for reflecting the effectiveness in the proposed control method. The outcomes obtained are studied and analysed with the existing control scheme to highlight the improvement obtained by proposed control.",

		"Abstract": "This paper proposes a hierarchical active power differential signal-based generalized backup protection algorithm using Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS) data for Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS)-compensated transmission networks. The proposed algorithm can be used for backup protection of transmission systems with any shunt and series-type FACTS devices. The increased number of FACT compensators affects the reliable operation of primary and backup protection of the transmission lines. Both shunt and series compensated lines cause malfunctioning of existing backup protection schemes. The proposed algorithm utilizes the sequence components of bus voltages and active power differential signals of lines to identify the faulty line. The algorithm is validated on a modified 9-bus system under MATLAB/SIMULINK platform. It is observed that the algorithm is suitable for identifying a faulty line in transmission systems containing both uncompensated and compensated lines with series or shunt-type FACTS controllers. This algorithm has the advantage that it uses a generalized backup protection logic and can be used for the accurate identification of a faulty line irrespective of the type of compensation devices.",

		"Abstract": "The smart grid is an intelligent power system network that should be reliable and resilient for sustainable operation. Wide-Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) are deployed in the power grid to provide real-time situational awareness to the power grid operators. An excellent strategy for exploiting the WAMS data effectively is to extract relevant insights from the increasing volume of data collected. Feature extraction techniques are pivotal in developing data-driven models for power systems. This paper proposes an ensemble feature extraction method for developing intelligent data-driven models for transmission line fault detection and classification. A comparative efficacy analysis of the proposed ensemble feature extraction method is carried out with state-of-the-art feature extraction methods. The models developed and evaluated with the feature data derived with the proposed method give an accuracy of 100% for fault detection and 99.78% for fault classification. This method also has the advantage of significantly reducing training and testing time. Features are extracted from the WAMS data collected by simulating an IEEE39 bus test system in the PowerWorld simulator.",

		"Abstract": "Power loss in the Distribution System (DS) is often higher than that of other parts of the power system because of its low voltage level. Therefore, reducing losses is always an important task in design and operation of the DS. This paper aims to apply a new approach based on Artificial Ecosystem Optimization (AEO) for the Distributed Generation Placement (DGP) and combination of DGP and network REConfiguration (DGP-REC) problems to reduce power loss of the DS to satisfy the technical constraints including power balance, radial topology, voltage and current bounds, and DG capacity limit. The AEO is a recent algorithm that has no special control parameters, inspired from the behaviours of living organisms in the ecosystem including production, consumption, and decomposition. The efficiency of the AEO is evaluated on two test systems including the 33-node and 119-node systems. The numerical results validated on the 33-node and 119-node systems show that DGP-REC is a more effective solution for reducing power loss compared to the DGP solution. In addition, evaluation results on small and large systems also indicate that AEO is an effective approach for the DGP and DGP-REC problems.",

		"Abstract": "Short-term electric power load forecasting is a critical and essential task for utilities of the electric power industry for proper energy trading and that enable the independent system operator to operate the network without any technical and economical issues.

Real time active power load data to train and test the machine learning model is collected from a 33/11 kV substation located in Telangana State, India. Based on the simulation results, it is observed that linear regression model can forecast the load with less mean absolute error i.e. 0.042 with training data and 0.045 with testing data in comparison with support vector regressor model for an hour ahead operation. Whereas in the case of the day ahead operation, linear regression model can forecast the load with less mean absolute error i.e. 0.055 with training data and 0.057 with testing data in comparison with support vector regressor model. A platform independent web application is developed to help the operators of the 33/11 kV substation which is located in Godishala, Telangana State, India.",

		"Abstract": "The essential purpose of an energy system is to provide electricity to its loads effectively and economically, as well as safely and reliably. Therefore, the solutions to the problems of Optimal Power Flow (OPF) and Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch (ORPD) to enable the efficient employment of various energy distributions should be found. Our work focuses on the ORPD issue; it can be formulated as a non-linear constraint and with single or multiple objectives optimization problems. Minimizing total losses is one of the main objective functions to solve the ORPD problem. This paper presents the use of an improved particle swarm optimization -with a disturbance term- (called PSO-DT) algorithm, to find the solution of ORPD in the standard IEEE 30-bus power system for reducing electrical power transmission losses. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient and has a more extraordinary ability to get better solutions compared to the basic PSO method.",

		"Abstract": "The application of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is increasing in many countries, causing many researchers to focus on EV Rapid Charging Station (RCS) related issues. The optimal planning of RCS considering only distribution networks is not a reliable approach. Moreover, the RCS location should be convenient to the EV user in a given EV driving range and the performance of the distribution system. In this paper, a multi-objective approach for optimal planning of RCS and Distributed Generators (DG) in a distributed system coupled with a transportation network is analyzed. The proposed optimal planning method aims to achieve reduced active power loss, EV user costs, and voltage deviation for effective RCS and DG planning. The approach includes the analysis of the test system with the base case, solo planning of RCS, planning of DGs with fixed RCS, and simultaneous optimal planning of RCS and DGs. Daily load variation at buses and hourly charging probability of EVs have been used in the analysis. IEEE 33 bus distribution system superimposed with a 25-node transportation network is considered the test system. Rao 3 algorithm is applied for optimization, and the results have been compared with PSO and JAYA algorithms.",

		"Abstract": "The prime purpose of placing a capacitor bank in a power system is to provide reactive power, reduce power losses, and enhances voltage profile. The main challenge is to determine the optimum capacitor position and size that reduces both system power losses and the overall cost of the system with rigid constraints. For this purpose, different optimization techniques are used, for example Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which converges the complex non-linear problem in a systematic and methodological way to find the best optimal solution. In this paper, the standard IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems are used to find the optimum location and size of the capacitors bank. These power networks are simulated in Siemens PSS\u00aeE software. For the optimum solution of capacitor banks, the PSO algorithm is used. The PSO fitness function is modelled in such a way which contains the high average bus voltage, the small size of capacitor banks, and low power losses. The fitness function used is a weighted type to reduce the computation time and multi-objective function complexity.",

		"Abstract": "Wind Turbine Generators (WTG) are being integrated into distribution systems on a large scale worldwide as part of a global effort to capture green energy. Wind turbine generator intermittency may be mitigated by Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), which have emerged as a viable option in recent years. To find the best position and capacity for wind power generation and BESS charging/discharging dispatches, a Red Fox Optimisation (RFO) algorithm is used while optimising the imbalanced distribution network\u2019s performance under technological restrictions. The charging or discharging criteria for this method is the average feeder load. The charging techniques for BESS using WTG and Sustainable Average Load (SAL) are evaluated in terms of the free-running mode of dispatch cycle. The suggested approach is tested on an IEEE-37 bus Unbalanced Radial Distribution Network (UDN). It has been shown that the suggested method enhances several performance objectives of the distribution system.",

		"Abstract": "The safety and reliability of an electrical network depend on the performance of the protections utilized. Therefore, the optimal coordination of the protective devices plays an essential role. In this paper, a new algorithm, Equilibrium Optimizer (EO), which is based on the physical equation of the mass balance, is implemented in the problem of the Optimal Coordination of Directional Overcurrent Relays (DOCRs). Moreover, the proposed method uses Linear Programming (LP), Nonlinear Programming (NLP) and Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) in order to optimize the Time Dial Setting (TDS), as well as the Plug Setting (PS), satisfying all possible constraints. Additionally, the performance of EO is evaluated using several benchmarks with different topologies. The results demonstrated the applicability and efficacy of the proposed approach.

		"Abstract": "The uncertainty of the non-conventional sources especially solar energy caused due to spatio-temporal factors like temperature, pressure, relative humidity etc. is continuously disrupting the productivity and reliability of an integrated power system which motivates the researcher or energy industry for strategic forecasting solutions to enhance the proper scheduling and control of solar generation power plants. Several studies have been carried out; but still the objective of achieving accurate forecasting dependent on the spatio-temporal features is not achieved. To address this critical forecasting issue in this research article a hyper parametric tuning of the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) machine learning model has been carried out using two met heuristic algorithms: Moth Flame Optimization (MFO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO). The dataset comprises five years of metrological attributes collected from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for analysis. The validation of the proposed model has been done based on the five statistical errors: Max Error (ME), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Coefficient of Determination (R^2), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The regressive assessment of all three models has confirmed that the XGB-MFO model outperformed the others as showing the highest R^2 score of 0.9337, 0.9011, 0.8744 and lowest RMSE values of 76.29 Wcm^{-2}, 41.90 Wm^{-2} and 95.94Wm^{-2} for Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI) and Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) respectively which ensures the proposed model implementation for the prediction and production of solar power.",

		"Abstract": "Power system networks are one of the most widely used methods in the real world for transferring large amounts of electrical energy from one location to another. At present, High Voltage Direct Current Transmission is preferred for long distances over hundreds of miles due to minimal power loss and transmission cost of transmission.Due to an increase in power demand, integration of renewable sources to minimise the voltage fluctuations and compensate for power loss is necessary. This is a mandatory requirement to produce sophisticated protection methods for mainly smart systems under various balanced and unbalanced fault conditions. The system protection scheme must respond as quickly as possible to protect the connected devices in a smart environment. The network must be monitored and protected under various weather conditions as well as electrical parametric problems. The proposed research work is carried on the basis of physical monitoring with the aid of the Internet-of-Things and electrical parameters calibrated with the help of wavelet analysis. A wavelet is a mathematical tool to investigate the behaviour of transient signals at different frequencies, which provides important information related to the detailed analysis of faults in power networks. The major goals of this research are to analyse faults using detailed coefficients of current signals through the bior-1.5 mother wavelet for fault identification and artificial neural network analysis for fault localization. This proposed approach furnishes an IoT supervised Photovoltaic - High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) combined wide area power network security scheme using wavelet detailed coefficients under various types of faults with Fault-Inception-Angles.",

		"Abstract": "The signaling resources expended and the power consumed by User Equipments (UEs) in the Location Management (LM) procedures are expected to be higher in Fifth Generation (5G) than in legacy wireless communications networks. To mitigate this challenge, this work proposes a hybrid scheme that mitigates the signaling resources expended in paging and RAN-based Notification Area Update (RNAU) procedures in 5G. The approach utilizes a hybrid scheme that embeds a UE Identifier (UEID) partitioning scheme that directional pages UEs into a gNB-based UE Mobility Tracking (UEMT) scheme. The approach configures a gNB in an RRC_Inactive state to beam sweep a UEs last registered cell area before directionally paging the UE. The approach proposed in this work is implemented on a modified network architecture to reduce the signaling resources expended on both paging and RNAU of UEs at higher frequencies which is an enabling factor for mmWave systems. Simulation results of the total accumulated cost of paging showed a 65.13 % and 8.69 % reduction in signaling resources expended against the conventional approach and the existing gNB-based UEMT approach, respectively. Additionally, the total accumulated resources expended in both procedures over 24 hours showed that the modified gNB-based UEMT scheme outperformed the conventional scheme and the gNB-based UEMT scheme by 90.96 % and 38.36 %, respectively.",

		"Abstract": "The neurobiological origin of dyslexia allows the study of this disorder by examining functional connectivity between regions of the brain. During rest-state or at task completion, Electroencephalograms (EEG) are used to observe brain signals. By using Partial Directed Coherence (PDC) analysis, the correct analysis of functional connectivity was assessed. In spite of that, the estimation of functional connectivity can be inaccurate due to the presence of artifacts. Several methods have been employed by researchers to remove artifacts, including Moving Average Filters (MAF), Wiener Filters (WF), Wavelet Transforms (WT), and hybrid filters. Despite this, no research has been conducted on the effects of artifact removal methods on functional connectivity. Consequently, Artifact Cancellation (AC) algorithms are developed to reduce the effects of eye blinks, eye movements, and muscle movements on functional connectivity estimation. In this work, the denoising filters discussed earlier are utilized as part of the AC algorithm. Additionally, a comparison was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the filters. According to the results, AC-MAF removed all artifacts with the least computational complexity after improving the MAF. In order to test its efficacy in real-world conditions, it was applied to the real signals recorded while children with dyslexia were participating in rapid automatized naming activities. Utilizing the PDC approach, the developed algorithm accurately assessed functional connectivity.",

		"Abstract": "Protective relays are installed in generation, transmission, and distribution system for detection, classification, and estimation of faults. To match the  future load demand and to get uninterrupted power supply, use of renewable energy sources are increasing day by day. Faults can occur in transmission lines, transformers, generators, and busbars but the nature of these faults may change many times when renewable energy sources are considered. This research paper introduce techniques to detect and classify different faults on transmission line in the presence of wind energy sources using efficient tools of artificial intelligence. The main challenges of the system fault detection, in presence of wind turbine lie in their non-linearity, uncertainty and unknown disturbances. PSCAD/EMTDC software tool is used to simulate the power system model with RES which is implemented in MATLAB and Python software. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms have been used to classify and detect faults on transmission lines connected with wind energy source. The proposed technique has been validated for internal faults on transmission line and external faults on power system. In total of 4320 internal and external fault cases with wide variation in system parameters have been used for validation of the proposed model. The proposed model gives an overall fault zone identification accuracy of more than 99% in presence of wind energy source. The results obtained from validation show that the performance of SVM classifier is better than ANN in term of efficacy and classification time.",

		"Abstract": "This paper proposes a super-twisting sliding mode control for a multifunctional system that includes a Photovoltaic (PV) system connected to the grid through the Active Power Filter (APF). The latter is implemented to improve the power quality in the grid side, and injecting the provided photovoltaic power into the grid. Sliding mode control is known as a powerful control with good performance in transient and steady-state conditions. In this work, a Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control (ST-SMC) is applied to extract the maximum power from the PV source, corresponding to the irradiation level, as well as to the three-phase inverter-based-APF power control. For the system to inject the generated power from the PV source into the grid with respect to the international standards, fulfilling the active power filtering, synchronous reference frame theory is used to generate the appropriate reference signals for harmonic and reactive power compensation. To test the multi-functionality of the system (PV-APF), this one is connected to a grid supplying nonlinear loads that absorb non-sinusoidal currents. Through the simulation results, it has successfully achieved the multi-functionality of the proposed system under steady-state and dynamic conditions. The results also show the effectiveness and moderation of the proposed super-twisting sliding mode control. Furthermore, a comparative study has been established over the conventional PI controller, showing the clear superiority of the proposed control in every aspect.",

		"Abstract": "Improving the behavior of speed control in electric vehicles is currently a major challenge for researchers and engineers. For this study, we chose the context of a Switched Reluctance Motor (6/4 SRM) used in a hybrid Electric Vehicle with Extended Range (EREV). Speed regulation is an essential feature on long-distance trip. Speed regulators of backstepping type are very effective in this context given the non-linear nature of switched reluctance motors. The estimation of non-linear quantities, flux and inductance, uses Legendre polynomials. The control strategy uses four regulators, one for speed and three for stator currents. It is based on the Torque Sharing Function (TSF) and the Torque Inverse Model (TIM). Our simulation consists of studying the behavior of this type of control when an Inter-Turn Short-Circuit (ITSC) fault appears on one of the phases of the 6/4 SRM. In this paper, we are interested in temporal behavior of phasic currents and we will show the interest of these quantities as fault indicators allowing the real time diagnosis of this type of controller-machine.",

		"Abstract": "This paper proposes a novel linear precoding method for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based on the employment of the chaotic waveforms generated by the fourth-order chaotic oscillator and orthonormalized by the Gram-Schmidt process. The proposed linear precoding method is aimed to increase resilience to the multipath propagation issues and reduce the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signal. Moreover, the chaotic waveform enables novel timing synchronization methods to be implemented in the receiver. The modelling of baseband Linear Precoded OFDM (LP-OFDM) data transmission system with Rayleigh channel has been performed in Simulink environment to validate the proposed method and to compare the performance to the classic precoding methods, such as Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT). Experiments have shown that in a high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) scenario, the employment of the novel precoding scheme allows reducing Bit Error Ratio (BER) by several dB compared to non-precoded OFDM. The proposed precoding method leads to the reduction of PAPR; however, it is not as efficient as classical precoding schemes, such as WHT. Experimental evidence of synchronization of the chaotic oscillators within 50 samples long time interval is presented.",

		"Abstract": "Leading digital circuits namely register, flipflops, state machines and counters drive operational aspects and potential applications in Integrated Circuit (IC) industry. MOS Current Mode Logic (MCML) based implementations with rapid response and simultaneous generation of complemented output is all set to become indispensable in nano regime industry. This paper attempts to optimize and address performance-based analysis of digital circuits namely NAND, D flipflop and 3-bit asynchronous counter by practicing MCML based implementation. These circuits are contemplated on four design parameters namely delay (t_p), power (pwr), Power Delay Product (PDP) and Energy Delay Product (EDP). This research focuses on relative analysis and emanate a salient optimal application of Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) and Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistor (CNFET) based 3-bit asynchronous counter. In addition to this, the two configurations of the MCML counter are then compared against applied V_DD at 16-nm technology nodes using HSPICE simulator. CNFET based 3-bit MCML counter is observed to be much faster (9.75x), significant improvement in gross power dissipation (11.93x), material refinement in PDP and EDP (116.39x and 1165x) respectively as compared to the conventional counterpart. Therefore, CNFET based implementations comes to the fore as resilient technology supporting high level integration in nano scale regime.",

		"Abstract": "In the prominent era of the digital world and Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits, Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) provides a vital contribution to low-power and high-speed performance. Sense Amplifiers (SA) are a part of Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) memories used to read the stored information. This paper indicates a Dual-Voltage, Dual-Tail Level Restoration Voltage Latch Sense Amplifier (DVDTLR-VLSA). The design has been implemented using the LT SPICE tool at 180nm technology node with a 1.8V supply. Performance comparison of existing SA presented in literature with the proposed SA is examined based on different parameters like power, energy, delay, and current. The proposed design maintains power at 2.167uW that is decreased to half as against Dual Switch Transmission Gate Voltage SA (DTGVSA) and shows an appreciable depletion. Also, the current and delay results are improved. Dimensional analysis is also done for the proposed SA to examine the performance. After that, the effect of sleep transistors on the proposed SA examines the performance in comparison to delay and power parameters without sleep transistors. The DVDTLR-VLSA has minimal energy and power. Also, the delay is improved which may be determined more advisable for low-power operations.",

		"Abstract": "Wireless communication is a fast-growing industry and recent developments focus on improving certain aspects of the area and reducing the power consumption while maintaining the frequency of operation. Phase Locked Loop (PLL) is an integral part of communication circuits which operate at very high frequencies. Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) is the first block of PLL and is key in determining the computational capacity of the PLL. The power consumption of the PFD has to be reduced to minimize the overall power consumption of PLL. The PFD architecture used is based on Double Edged Triggered D Flip-Flop (DET-DFF), which is free of dead zone. Stack, LECTOR, AVLS and hybrid low-power approaches are implemented to reduce the power consumption of DET-DFF based PFD architectures. The PFDs power, delay and power delay product analysis is performed using Cadence Virtuoso and Spectre in CMOS 180nm and 90nm technology. A power reduction of up to 32% has been observed while keeping the transistor count to a minimum.",

		"Abstract": "This work presents the quadrature sinusoidal oscillator using two Voltage Differencing-Differential Input Buffered Amplifiers (VD-DIBAs), two resistors, and two capacitors. The VD-DIBA is an electronically controllable active building block with high input and low output impedances that can connect to other circuits directly without the buffers. With these distinguished features, the VD-DIBA is employed in this design. The proposed oscillator can produce two sine waves with a phase shift of 90 degrees. Over the entire tuning frequency range, the magnitude of the quadrature output voltages is constant. The proposed oscillator is independently adjustable in terms of frequency and oscillation condition. Moreover, the frequency of oscillation can be electronically and linearly adjusted by the bias currents. The condition of oscillation is adjustable by resistors, R_1 and R_2. The performances of the proposed quadrature oscillator are tested through the PSpice simulation and the experiment. In the simulation, the VD-DIBA is built from the 0.18um Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) CMOS process with +-0.9V supply voltages. In the experiment, the VD-DIBA is implemented using the commercial ICs, LM13700, and AD830 with +-5V supply voltages. The simulated Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) values of the output voltages, V_o1 and V_o2 at f_0 = 1.03MHz are 1.63% and 1.81%, respectively. The experimental THD values of the output voltages, V_o1 and V_o2 at f_0 = 536.6kHz, are 1.43% and 1.00%, respectively.",

		"Abstract": "Today Electromyography (EMG) and accelerometer (MEMS) based signals can be used in the clinical diagnosis of physical states of muscle activities such as fatigue, muscle weakness, pain, and tremors and in external or wearable robotic exoskeletal systems used in rehabilitation areas. During the recording of these signals taken from the skin surface through non-invasive processes, analysis of the signal becomes difficult due to the electrodes attached to the skin not fully contacting, involuntary body movements, and noises from peripheral muscles. In addition, parameters such as age and skin structure of the subjects can also affect the signal. Considering these negative factors, a new adaptive method based on Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) model for more effective filtering of the muscle signals based on both EMG and MEMS is proposed in this study. Moreover, the accuracy of the parametric values determined by the filter automatically according to the most effective time and frequency features that represent noisy and filtered signals was determined by different machine learning and classification algorithms. It was verified that the filter performs adaptive filtering with 100% effectiveness with Linear Discriminant.",

		"Abstract": "From the beginnings of ITU-T H.261 to H.265 (HEVC), each new video coding standard has aimed at halving the bitrate at the same perceptual quality by redundancy and irrelevancy reduction. Each improvement has been explained by comparably small changes in the video coding toolset. This contribution aims at starting the Quality of Experience (QoE) analysis of the accumulated improvements over the last thirty years. Based on an overview of the changes in the coding tools, we analyze the changes in the quantized residual information. Visual comparison and statistical measures are performed and some interpretations are provided towards explaining how irrelevancy reduction may have led to such a huge reduction in bitrate. The interpretation of the results in terms of QoE paves the way towards an understanding of the coding tools in terms of visual quality. It may help in understanding how the irrelevancy reduction has been improved over the decades. Understanding how the differences of the residuals relate to known or yet unknown properties of the human visual system, may enable a closer collaboration between perception research and video compression research.",

		"Abstract": "Microgrids are able to dispatch power to distribution systems with the advancement of power electronics-based inverters. As per IEEE-1547-2018 standards, Microgrid has to maintain voltage of 0.88 < V < 1.1 p.u (per unit) and frequency of 58.8< f_0 < 61.2 Hz and detect un-intentional faults in less than 2 seconds to bring Microgrid into islanding mode seamlessly. Unless these faults are detected and Microgrid is islanded, the system stability cannot be maintained and Microgrid cannot feed the connected loads. To detect these unsymmetrical faults, to bring the Microgrid to islanding mode and to be stable during non-islanding cases like loads switch on and throw off at Point of Common Coupling (PCC), a passive islanding detection method, Rate Of Change Of Voltage Phase Angle (ROCOVPA) is proposed. The methodology is simple. First, the voltage phase angle of generator bus and the grid is monitored. Then, absolute value is found and finally differentiated to get ROCOVPA and detect islanding. Also, this technique is compared with the widely used method of Rate Of Change Of Frequency (ROCOF) at different percentage active and reactive power mismatches. It also avoids nuisance tripping so that Microgrid's stability is maintained. This method is tested for un-symmetrical double line fault, for islanding cases and switch on or throw off, for non-islanding cases with linear and non-linear loads. In this method, the power quality is also not affected because of no perturbations during testing and the Non-Detection Zone (NDZ) is almost zero. The proposed method is verified by simulating islanding and non-islanding conditions in MATLAB/Simulink and by comparing with ROCOF method and found effective.",

		"Abstract": "The paper proposes a novel Optimum Frequency AC (OFAC) transmission system for reducing investment and operational cost of Electric System (ES) - integrating Offshore Wind Farm (OWF) to the onshore grid. Optimum operational frequency for ES is an inherent characteristic of the trade-off between its investment and operational cost. The paper presents a comprehensive methodology for the design of ES based on Life Cost Analysis using a Generic Algorithm. For the given offshore wind farm, alternative designs for ES are generated for different operational frequencies. Power system components of standard ratings are used for the designs. All the designs are evaluated in terms of~Net Present Values (NPV) and the design with maximum NPV is selected as the optimum solution. For 200 MW OWF, optimum operational frequencies are obtained as 50, 35, 25, and 50/3 Hz for offshore distances of 50, 100, 150, and 200 km, respectively. The results show that for 200 MW the feasible range for OFAC is 100-150 km and provides the saving of 5-10% as compared to High Voltage AC (HVAC) and Low-Frequency AC (LFAC). The results further indicate that for large-scale wind farms the saving increases substantially and the feasible range is reduced. It concludes that OFAC is an economical alternative to HVAC and LFAC for integrating large-scale OWF to the onshore grid and provides a new dimension for promoting Offshore Wind Power Plant (OWPP).",

		"Abstract": "The overall efficacy of power distribution is reduced through power loss in distribution systems owing to branch resistance. For providing quality power to customers, power losses must be diminished, and voltages must be enhanced. This paper introduces a novel improvement for the traditional Salps Swarm Algorithm (SSA) called Enhance SSA (ESSA) for selecting Optimal Shunt Capacitor Ratings and their Locations (OSCRL). ESSA is viewed as an enhanced version of SSA with the aim of improving the SSA's poor performance. A multi-objective function was designed in this work for reducing real power loss and Total System Cost (TSC), as well as, improving feeder voltage profile and maximizing Net Savings (NSs) per year under security restrictions. For validating and evaluating the proposed ESSA technique, a practical 33-bus local Iraqi and standard IEEE 69-bus Radial Distribution Systems (RDSs) were used as test systems through utilizing MATLAB. The experimental results attained by the proposed ESSA are compared with other approaches currently available in the literature for addressing OSCRL problem. The experimental results prove the efficacy and supremacy of the ESSA to other literature algorithms with respect to diminishing power loss as well as TSC, reinforce bus voltage profile and increase NSs per year for multiple RDSs.",

		"Abstract": "This paper contributes to the energy management of a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS), comprising a lithium-ion battery and Supercapacitors (SCs) for a grid-connected photovoltaic system. In general, an Energy Storage System (ESS) can offset the intermittency of renewable energy. However, ESS can absorb large amounts of energy with slow dynamics, but can only absorb fast dynamics when subjected to high currents, which quickly contributes to their wear. To avoid this, SCs are added to energy storage as a supplement to batteries. There are various methods for power-sharing, including the most common, which uses the Low-Pass Filter (LPF). This article proposes a new technique to distribute power between the battery and the SCs using the zero-compensator filter of the battery regulator. Also, this technique is based on the compensation of the energy dissipated by the battery through the SCs. Besides, the State of Charge (SoC) of the battery is kept within safe boundaries. The proposed technique is compared to the ESS and classical HESS techniques. The simulation results confirmed the efficacy of the proposed method of rapidly restoring the DC-link voltage and improving the battery lifespan. In addition, this technique is adaptable to the stand-alone site, and the AC currents showed good quality.",

		"Abstract": "In This paper, a simple single-dimension Space Vector Modulation (SVM) technique is introduced to implement on three-phase thirteen-level Modified Packed U-Cell (MPUC) inverter for photovoltaic system in which many DC sources are available. The three-phase thirteen-level converter consists of three single-phase seven-level MPUCs that each phase has six switches and two isolated DC sources. One major advantage of proposed method is to produce an output voltage with nearly constant amplitude in desired range in case of input DC voltage fluctuations, which is common in renewable sources like Photovoltaic Systems (PV). On the other hand, the conventional Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) strategies do not have such capability. Thus, the converter behavior is investigated for the proposed control method and Level Shift PWM (LS-PWM) and it is shown that the LS-PWM method does not function properly when the DC voltage varies. In order to produce an output voltage with seven equal levels, which results in reduction of the switching losses and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), it is necessary to trigger switches in proper way. Consequently, two switching patterns are introduced and the significant decrease in power loss due to the second switching pattern is shown. Furthermore, it is investigated that in three-phase mode, the 3rd order line-voltage harmonics are eliminated well and the voltage and current THD are further improved by the proposed method. To validate the proposed SVM technique, MATLAB Simulink simulation results are presented and a comparative analysis is done between the proposed method and LS-PWM.",

		"Abstract": "An Adaptive Nonlinear PID (ANLPID) controller for six Degrees of Freedom (6-DOF) Underwater Robotic Vehicle (URV) model is proposed to solve the path tracking problem. The path tracking problem is mainly caused by external environmental disturbances and the unknown uncertainties of the URV model. The ANLPID controller is used to estimate both the external disturbances and the unknown URV uncertainties. The performance of the ANLPID controller was evaluated by comparing the ANLPID controller with other existing works that are Nonlinear PID (NLPID) controller and Nonlinear Fractional PID (NLFOPID) controller. The system stability is proved by utilizing the Lyapunov function. At the end, the results obtained show the proficiency of the ANLPID controller, where the ANLPID controller improved the performance of the URV by 41.4185% compared to the NLPID controller and by 54.6479% compared to the NLFOPID controller.",

Various samples with different electrode size and number of spiral electrodes were fabricated and characterized. To obtain the optimum output power density, response surface methodology was employed. The experiments were designed based on the central composite design approach for different combinations of the electrode turn number and the electrode width and pitch. To show the validity and accuracy of the method, the predicted results were compared with additional experimental results which a good concordance between the results. Contours of output power density for different combinations of the design variables were plotted.

		"Abstract": "Brain Computer Interface enables individuals to communicate with devices through ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) signals in many applications that use brainwave-controlled units. This paper presents a new algorithm using EEG waves for controlling the movements of a drone by eye-blinking and attention level signals. Optimization of the signal recognition obtained is carried out by classifying the eye-blinking with a Support Vector Machine algorithm and converting it into 4-bit codes via an artificial neural network. Linear Regression Method is used to categorize the attention to either low or high level with a dynamic threshold, yielding a 1-bit code. The control of the motions in the algorithm is structured with two control layers. The first layer provides control with eye-blink signals, the second layer with both eye-blink and sensed attention levels. EEG signals are extracted and processed using a single channel NeuroSky MindWave 2 device. The proposed algorithm has been validated by experimental testing of five individuals of different ages. The results show its high performance compared to existing algorithms with an accuracy of 91.85% for 9 control commands. With a capability of up to 16commands and its high accuracy, the algorithm can be suitable for many applications.",

		"Abstract": "Electric Vehicles (EVs) are a promising alternative to conventional vehicles powered by internal combustion motors, of fering the possibility of reducing CO2, pollutants, and noise emissions. As known, the control of such an electric vehicle takes into account several phenomena governing its behavior, which is a complicated problem because of the non-linearities, unmeasured disturbance, and parameters uncertainty of this system. This problem is one of the important challenges facing controller designers. Various control techniques have been proposed to enhance EV\u2019s performance. On this basis, in this research, a new synergetic scheme of electric vehicles propelled by Six-Phase Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSMs) is developed. The synthesis of the proposed Synergetic Controller (SC) is based on the selection of four-manifolds of stator current of PMSMs. The SC provides fast response, asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system in wide range operating condition, and decrease the size of modeled system. Also, the principal feature of SC is that it supports parameters variation. Furthermore, to illustrate the improvements and the performances of the proposed controller, a comparison study between various nonlinear controllers such as Integral Action in Sliding Mode (ISMC), Super Twisting Sliding Mode (STSM), using a dynamic model of the lightweight vehicle under New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) was done. The obtained simulation results under several operating conditions show the efficiency and superiority of the proposed control compared with nonlinear controllers; also, it demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed control approach for real systems.",

		"Abstract": "5G networks are started to be deployed in urban areas in the dynamic spectrum sharing mode. Therefore, the analysis of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) shadowing effects behind buildings of different heights becomes particularly important. The shadowing of GSM (900 MHz), UMTS (2100 MHz) and LTE (1800 MHz) technologies was investigated in the urban area. The results are examined by using the log-normal path loss model and four different stochastic equations, specifically: normal, log-normal, Rayleigh, and Nakagami. The results showed that the fluctuations of path losses in the urban area correspond to the model of log-normal path losses. However, path losses for individual buildings do not fit this model. Therefore, stochastic methods were used to analyse shadowing effects. A path loss model based on a differential stochastic equation was proposed. This model includes the following values: free space losses, path losses disturbance due to the shadowing effect, standard deviation \u03c3, and a freely chosen parameter b. This model allows a very accurate estimate of the path losses of the three technologies. A clear correlation was observed between parameter b and standard deviation \u03c3.",

		"Abstract": "The determination of the buried objects and cracks in building structures is an important issue in real-life. In this paper, we propose a new method called Correlation Function Separation Technique (CFST) combine with the Lervenberg-Marquardt Algorithm (LMA) using the Impulse Radio Ultra-Wide Band (IR-UWB) penetrating system to improve the accuracy in detecting and positioning of the adjacent buried objects in building structures. Based on the UWB signal processing, the proposed method can be used to determine both the relative permittivity of the environment and the position of the buried objects,  especially the adjacent objects. The analytical method is validated by mathematical proofs and Matlab simulations, and the position errors are used to assess the performance of proposed method. The numerical results shown that the proposed method can be used for positioning the adjacent buried objects in the homogeneous environment which has an average positioning error of 3.52cm, which is smaller than that of the conventional method based on B-canned radar images processing.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, the Half-Duplex Relay Channel (HDRC) is thoroughly investigated. Even though this channel model is widely studied, the capacity is not yet fully understood and particularly has not been tightly expressed. In this work, a new capacity expression of the discrete memoryless HDRC is explicitly established. In particular, a new expression of the achievable rate is derived by taking advantage of the well-known capacity results of both the degraded broadcast channel and the multiple access channel. Specifically, in order to obtain the achievable rate, the transmission from the source to destination is operated over two phases. In the first phase, the broadcast phase, the source broadcasts to both relay and destination. In the second phase, both source and relay transmit to destination to form multiple access channel. Then, we prove that the new achievable rate meets the cut-set outer bound such that the capacity of the discrete memoryless HDRC is attained. Next, the new derived capacity result is extended to the case of additive Gaussian channel. Further, the attained capacity is analytically and then numerically shown to encompass  all well-known available findings in the literature. Additional numerical examples are also shown to present the cases in which the relay is beneficial and how the achievable capacity varies with the source-relay and relay-destination channel gains.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents a method for capacitance scaling of Fractional Capacitor (FC) which is implemented using Current Feedback Operational Amplifiers (CFOA) based Capacitance Multipliers (C Multipliers). The circuit facilitates the change in FC value without changing component values in R-C network used for FC modelling or fabricating a new FC. The performance of the proposed circuit is examined for non ideal effects of CFOA. Effective impedance of scaled FC is examined through MATLAB simulations. The functionality of the realized scalers is verified using SPICE simulations where the FC is modelled using domino RC ladder network. Simulation results for impedance magnitude and phase responses are presented for various scaling factors and are compared with theoretical counterparts. The circuit application of proposed FC scaler is demonstrated through implementation of fractional order lossy and lossless integrators; and may be extended to fractional order filters, oscillators, controllers etc.",

		"Abstract": "Power and area estimation in the early stage of designing is very critical for a system. This paper presents the neural network-based early area and power estimation model. The flow starts with the training of the neural network model from the selected behavioral level parameters, which imposes to provide accurate estimations. The model accuracy is validated against ITC99 benchmark programs. The run-times are faster than the synthesis run-times. For the ASIC-based designs, the proposed model took 5 seconds, while Synopsys Design Compiler took 5 minutes. In terms of timing, the estimation speed is more than the order of magnitude faster than the conventional synthesis-based approach. The modeling methodology provides a better, accurate, and fast area and power estimations, at an early stage of the Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) design. In addition, the model eliminates the need for synthesis-based exploration and provides the design picking before synthesis.",

		"Abstract": "This article presents an outline of Electric Transient Disturbances (ETDs), represented by the ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) in accordance with the Human-Body Model (HBM), on the AC-DC transfer measurement standard, represented by the Single-Junction Thermal Converter (SJTC) Thermal Element (TE). Mitigation technique against the power dissipation build-up, higher than the operational margins recommended by a manufacturer, on the TE were proposed and modelled using Laplace Transform (LT) analysis. A mathematical model and an optimization algorithm were developed to determine the equivalent circuit model parameters of a Transient Overload Protection Module (TOPM) that would offer adequate protection against destructive power dissipation levels build-up on the TE. The mathematical model was developed using an 8 kV ESD, which was expected to deliver short-circuit current with a peak value of approximately 5.33 A through a load impedance of approximately 1 m\\varOmega. The ESD stress signal was injected into the TOPM connected in parallel with the TE. The active power dissipated by the SJTC TE per period of transient response was calculated from the current and voltage obtained from the mathematical analysis, and the results indicate a power dissipation of 10 mW by the TE. From the algorithm, the model parameter that noticeably influences the power dissipation capabilities of the TOPM is the inductance and it must be smaller than 1.2 nH. A CAD based simulation model was developed and analysed. The simulation results agreed with the mathematical model.",

		"Abstract": "The choice of gate metal technology for junctionless transistors needs to have diverse characteristics as metals have distinct work functions and hence, they show incompatibility while tailoring threshold of the device. In such a scenario, bimetallic stacked gate can be a promising candidate to present wide range of tunable work functions required for nano-regime junctionless transistors. This paper explores the electronic phenomena occurring at metal-metal interface and the impact of Platinum (Pt)/Titanium (Ti) bimetallic stacked gate-based work function tunability on the RF and thermal performances of p-type window-based Silicon on Insulator Junctionless Transistor (SOI JLT) using numerical simulator SILVACO ATLAS. The parameters considered for performance evaluation are ON-state current (I_{ON}), OFF-state current (I_{OFF}), I_{ON}/I_{OFF} ratio, transconductance (g_m),\\linebreak cutoff frequency (f_T), Transconductance Frequency Product (TFP), Intrinsic Gate Delay (IGD), intrinsic gain (A_V), and Global Device Temperature (GDT). The g_m, f_T, TFP, A_V and GDT improve for modified over conventional in the ON state at higher work function, while IGD improves at lower work function. The improvements of 11.7% and 2.21% are obtained in maximum g_m and f_T, respectively, for modified transistor over conventional. The findings suggest that bimetallic stacked gate modified SOIJLT is a better option than conventional for low-power RF application.",

		"Abstract": "This paper investigates a degradation of three types of automotive power MOSFETs through repetitive Unclamped Inductive Switching (UIS) test typically used to evaluate the avalanche robustness of power devices. It is not uncommon in switching applications that greater than the planned voltage for voltage spikes can occur, so even the best electronic designs may encounter frequent avalanche events. Hence, there is a need to analyse the impact of repetitive avalanching on the electrical performance of power transistors. This article focused on the shift of main electrical parameters: on-resistance R_{ON}, breakdown voltage V_{BR}, threshold voltage V_{TH}, and corresponding characteristics, as well as capacitances. Analysis proved that DMOS transistors are less vulnerable to repetitive avalanching. The most impacted parameter was on-resistance R_{DSon}, where a 14 % increase was observed after 6 x 10^7 stress pulses. The parameters shift is attributed to hot carrier injection in the space charge region of blocking PN junction and involves mainly defects generation/activation in the drain side region of the gate oxide. For the TrenchMOS transistor, a significant shift of I-V curves was observed with considerable impact on the R_{ON} where an increase of 22 % was observed. The trench corner is verified to be the mainly degraded region by Synopsys Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) simulations. Degradation of drain-gate capacitance C_{DG} and input capacitance C_{in} was observed in all three types of analysed structures. DLTS was used to verify the generation/activation of defects invoked by stress. An increase of DLTS signal corresponding to energy levels of oxygen vacancies and impurities in SiO_2 and on interfaces were detected on stressed samples.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, Bidimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition (BEMD) based Cross Bilateral Filter (CBF) technique for speckle reduction in ultrasound images has been proposed. The reference image is obtained by denoising the noisy image using pixel-wise Wiener filtering. Then, both the noisy image and the reference image are decomposed into a set of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and the residue image using BEMD technique. CBF is applied between noisy image IMFs and the corresponding reference image IMFs. The image is reconstructed back with these modified IMFs and the residue. The proposed method exploits the edge information in the reference image for improving the quality of the denoised image. The performance of the proposed method has been tested for real ultrasound images and simulated images having noise of different variance. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than other state-of-art methods in terms of Edge Keeping Index (EKI), Correlation Coefficient (CC), Figure of Merit (FOM), Structural Similarity (SSIM), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) for synthetic images. The algorithm gives better performance for real ultrasound images in terms of Mean to Variance Ratio (MVR) and Equivalent Number of Looks (ENL).",

Scanning electron microscopy scanned the surface morphology of carbon films. Raman spectroscopy was used for chemical structural properties determination of very thin carbon films. Raman spectra intensities were fitted with Gaussian peaks. The photo-induced (pulsed laser - 266 nm) electron emission properties of very thin nanostructured carbon films were investigated by the measurement of cathode bunch charge at different electric field and calculate quantum efficiency.

		"Abstract": "Research on data-driven bearing fault diagnosis techniques has recently drawn more and more attention due to the availability of massive condition monitoring data. The research work presented in this paper aims to develop an architecture for the detection and diagnosis of bearing faults in the induction machines. The developed data-oriented architecture uses vibration signals collected by sensors placed on the machine, which is based, in the first place, on the extraction of fault indicators based on the harmonics-to-noise ratio envelope. Normalisation is then applied to the extracted indicators to create a well-processed data set. The evolution of these indicators will be studied afterwards according to the type and severity of defects using sequential backward selection technique. Supervised machine learning classification methods are developed to classify the measurements described by the feature vector with respect to the known modes of operation. In the last phase concerning decision making, ten classifiers are tested and applied based on the selected and combined indicators. The developed classification methods allow classifying the observations, with respect to the different modes of bearing condition (outer race, inner race fault or healthy condition). The proposed method is validated on data collected using an experimental bearing test bench. The experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture achieves high accuracy in bearing fault detection under all operational conditions. The results show that, compared to some proposed approaches, our proposed architecture can achieve better performance overall in terms of the number of optimal features and the accuracy of the tests.",

		"Abstract": "This paper deals with a system that consists of a combination of wind and solar sources. The wind energy unit is the primary energy source that feeds the load and is controlled by the I cos Phi algorithm. The algorithm\u2019s efficiency is tested under normal operation and when one of the phases in the load is disconnected. This algorithm efficiently maintains the voltage and frequency during these conditions. The solar unit is directly connected with the battery energy storage system and is used to charge the battery. It implements MPPT using Perturb and Observe (P&O) method. The hybrid system is simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK. It is found to perform and maintain the frequency and the potential at the load side and the point of common coupling under normal operation and varying load conditions. I cos Phi algorithm, which controls the switching signals, requires simple calculations for generating reference source currents. This algorithm does not need conversion from one frame to another, making the system respond for quick dynamics and improved power quality. The perturb and observe method is proven to ensure the maximum power extraction from the solar panel. Thus, the combination of these two techniques makes the system act efficiently and handle load disturbances.",

		"Abstract": "Due to the rising usage of various broadcasting systems and web-casting applications, a measurement of audio quality has become an essential task. This paper presents a benchmark of the parametric models for non-intrusive estimation of the audio quality perceived by the end user. The proposed solution is based on machine learning techniques for broadcasting systems and web-casting applications. The main goal of this study is to assess the performance of the non-intrusive parametric models as well as to evaluate a statistical significance of the performance differences between those models. The paper provides a comparison of several models based on the Support Vector Regression, Genetic Programming, Multigene Symbolic Regression, Neural Networks and Random Forest. The obtained results indicate that among the investigated models the most accurate, although not the fastest ones, are the model based on Random Forest (a broadcast scenario) and the SVR-based model (a web-cast scenario). These models represent promising candidates for non-intrusive parametric audio quality assessment in the context of broadcasting systems and web-casting applications.",

		"Abstract": "In the context of ambient Backscatter systems, Backscatter devices (tags and readers) transmit data by employing existing Radio Frequency (RF) signals. Most prior works consider perfect hardware impairment and apply the Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) technique, but this paper investigates the case of Outage Probability (OP) reduction situation when the hardware is imperfect, especially when the Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technology is applied. Consequently, we design a downlink of transmission from base station to destination to highlight different performances among users. Furthermore, to indicate the impact of levels of hardware impairment, we develop the closed-form expressions of OP for different kinds of users. Finally, extensive simulation results validate the analysis and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.",

		"Abstract": "In any wide-range processing system, rapid interconnecting networks are employed between the processing modules and embedded systems. This study deals with the optimized design and implementation of Switching Element (SE) which operates in four modes, accepting two inputs and delivering two outputs. The Shuffle-Exchange Network (SEN) can be used as a single-stage as well as a multi-stage network. SEN is used as an interconnection architecture which is implemented with exclusive input-output paths with simple design. The SE acts as a building block to the Multi-stage Shuffle-Exchange Network (M-SEN) with facilities to perform unicast and multicast operation on the inputs. An 8x8 M-SEN model is also implemented, which works in three modes of communication, termed as \"One-to-One\", \"One-to-Many\" and \"One-to-All\" M-SEN configuration. All the QCA circuits have been implemented and simulated using CAD tool QCADesigner. The proposed QCA-based M-SEN design is better in terms of area occupied by 14.63%, average energy dissipation by 22.75% and cell count with a reduction of 84 cells when compared to reference M-SEN architecture. The optimization of the design in terms of cell count and area results in lesser energy dissipation and hence can be used in future-generation complex networks and communication systems.",

The obtained results show that the increases of gate bias effect on substrate lead to decreasing the source resistance of the simulated device. The reported increase in the effect of gate induces the increases of transferred holes concentration towards the source region and which induce the decreases of source resistance. The decrease of source resistance can also be made by reducing the buffer thickness which leads to an increase in the gate effect on the substrate. The source resistance value is influenced by the Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) effect where the rate of decreasing the source resistance will be decreasing consequently to increase the drain bias. The reduction of the source resistance induces the increase of device sensibility for lows values of current.",

		"Abstract": "Quantum cascade lasers are sophisticated devices mostly based on InGaAs/AlInAs/InP heterostructures to improve thermal performance. Their structure consists of a core containing hundreds or even thousands of thin layers, covered on both sides with thick cladding waveguides. Such a laser design creates enormous stresses in the core and can cause degradation of the entire device. An alternative to the thick InP claddings are thin, highly doped InGaAs layers used as plasmonic waveguides. This solution allows to achieve a mode confinement above 50% even at only 150 nm of the waveguide layer, which is extremely difficult in the case of standard designs.

		"Abstract": "Development of semiconductor devices based on AlGaN/GaN heterostructure requires study and improvement of ohmic contacts, whose necessary improvement lies in process of checking new metallic compositions and thermal formation process parameters. Usually, in metallic ohmic annealed contacts of AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, titanium is applied as the first layer, but scandium may be an alternative. It was proved to be useful to obtain both ohmic and Schottky characteristics, depending on annealing temperature of the contact. In the presented research, contacts including scandium (Sc/Al/Mo/Au) were fabricated, and, as reference sample, contacts with titanium including metallziation (Ti/Al/Mo/Au). Reference sample was annealed at 825\u00b0C, and forming temperatures for scandium contacts were 825\u00b0C, 625\u00b0C, and 425\u00b0C. All samples after thermal formation process were additionally thickened with Ru/Au bilayer. To quickly compare level of metals in metallization mixing during formation process and to check applicability of EDS (Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy), the simulations of electrons trajectories and EDS point scans were performed.",

		"Abstract": "On-die testing can accelerate development of semiconductor devices, but poses certain challenges related to high frequency and high current switching. This paper describes design and development of a tester for double-pulse switching test and measurement of dynamic on-state resistance of unpackaged High-Electron-Mobility Transistors (GaN HEMTs). The tester is capable of switching an inductive load at drain-to-source voltage up to 400 V and drain current up to 10 A. Design challenges resulting from specific properties of GaN HEMTs and on-die measurement are explained, and solutions are proposed. Essential parts of the developed device are described, including low inductance gate-driver and measurement methods. Modified drain voltage clamping circuit for accurate on-state drain voltage measurement is described. The tester is constructed as a printed circuit board, integrated into a probe station. Voltage and current waveforms are measured with oscilloscope and used to calculate the on-resistance. Results of a reference measurement with commercially available packaged transistors are presented. Waveforms measured on experimental unpackaged normally-off GaN HEMT samples are also presented and discussed. The proposed tester device proved to be capable of performing the dynamic on-resistance measurement with satisfactory results.",

		"Abstract": "In this report we present a new numerical approach and complex analysis of electron beam propagation based on a realistic model of an optimised imaging spherical deflector analyser. Electron beam trajectory simulations, carried out for real experimental boundaries, enabled us to reveal and explain the unique optical properties which were employed in the instrumental optimisation followed by empirical, spectromicroscopic applications. In terms of numerical treatment, it was possible to verify the low-aberration imaging in reciprocal and real spaces at \u03c0 and 2\u03c0, respectively, and the advantage of energy-selective visualisation of the k-space. Furthermore, this unique feature has been proven and confirmed experimentally by implementing the HeI/HeII monochromatic photon source into our improved spectromicroscopic system and by the energy-selective visualisation of an electronic state projection in the reciprocal plane. A clear correlation between a numerically simulated electronic projection and an experimentally-obtained k-space imaging has been demonstrated.",

		"Abstract": "This paper develops a mathematical model for analyzing the steady-state performance of the Slip Power Recovery Induction Motor Drive System (SPRIMDS) which operates under unbalance supply voltage conditions. The IEC definition indices of Voltage Unbalance Factor (VUF) and Complex Voltage Unbalance Factor (CVUF) which consist of magnitude and phase angle of the unbalance supply are used for the analysis. Also, this paper evaluates the impact of voltage unbalance and firing angle of the inverter on the stator and rotor motor parameters, motor currents, copper losses, efficiency, power factor, torque-speed characteristics, prediction of peak currents of the stator and rotor phase windings, and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of stator and rotor currents. The proposed mathematical model of SPRIMDS is validated using MATLAB-Simulink. The results have shown that the performance of the SPRIMDS and variation of motor currents, efficiency, THD and torque are depending on the magnitude of the voltage unbalance and inverter's firing angle.",

		"Abstract": "This article describes a new multipurpose Silicone-Carbide (SiC) Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) driver, which was designed and manufactured for a high frequency operating SiC transistor as a semiconductor switching device of power converters. The design of the introduced driver enables to adjust the output voltage levels easily by choosing the integrated linear voltage stabilizers with suitable output parameters used for Printed Circuit Board (PCB) mounting. The voltage insulation of the proposed driver between the primary control side and the secondary output side is performed by MGJ6D12H24MC muRata Ps DC-DC converter with a declared dv/dt immunity 80 kV/1000 ms at 1.6 kV and by IX3180 IXYS High Speed gate driver optocouplers with a declared 10 kV/1000 ms minimum common mode rejection at 1.5 kV. The voltage insulation of these coupling elements is accompanied by safety gaps on the PCB. These insulation features enable the proposed driver to work on high frequencies as a high-side transistor of H-bridges as same as in other power converter topologies with a high frequency and high voltage stress of the insulation border. The proposed driver also provides the possibility of tripping the signal, when the short circuit of the controlled power transistor occurs.",

		"Abstract": "In a wireless system, dual-hop transmission requires Full-Duplex (FD) to transmit signals from the base station too far users. It is more beneficial if we deploy non-orthogonal multiple access to serve specific users, i.e. normal users (near and far users) and device-to-device users. The fairness and outage performance of these users can be studied. We particularly focus on mathematical analysis of outage performance which is computed based on Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of received signals at each kind of user. We derive a closed-form formula of such outage probability along with throughput. To realize both the FD NOMA, this paper performs system performance metrics and considers how self-interference make influences system performance. The simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and show that our scheme can obtain a better outage probability and throughput performance with high transmit SNR at the base station and lower required target rates.",

		"Abstract": "The pulse with intra-pulse modulation plays an important role in the design of radar systems. The first class of the signals type is the linear frequency modulation technique. The linear frequency modulation is used to resolve range resolution problems. This paper provides a new algorithm for detecting linear frequency modulation signals at a low signal-to-noise ratio. The core idea of the proposed method is firstly to analyse the linear frequency modulation signals via Fast Fourier Transform; and then to accumulate all energy to achieve signal detection using cross-correlation methods. The proposed algorithm showed better results in comparison with current algorithms, which are used to estimate the parameters of the linear frequency modulation signals at a low signal-to-noise ratio.",

		"Abstract": "This paper has presented hard braking control system based on Adjustable Gain Enhanced Fuzzy Logic Controller (AGE-FLC) for optimal wheel slip ratio tracking performance. The purpose of the study was to improve slip ratio tracking and eliminate cycling while achieving very much shortened distance during emergency braking.  The model of a braking vehicle at speed of 30 m.s^-1 subject to wheel locking was developed and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink environment. Simulation was conducted without a controller to study the slip ratio performance of the system on different road surfaces. The simulation results showed that stopping distance was 135.2 m in 5 seconds. A Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) whose control signal was enhanced by adding an adjustable gain mechanism to its output was designed.  Simulation results showed that the AGE-FLC controller offered optimal tracking of desired wheel slip ratio of 0.1 as fast as possible on all road surface scenarios, while improving the stopping distance by 70.4% on dry road surface, 63.3% on wet road surface, 57.5% on cobblestone road surface and 48.8% on snow road surface in 2.651seconds.",

		"Abstract": "The ever-increasing demand for high-quality digital video requires efficient compression techniques and fast video codecs. It necessitates increased complexity of the video codec algorithms. So, there is a need for hardware accelerators to implement such complex algorithms. The latest video compression algorithms such as High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and Versatile Video Coding (VVC) have been adopted Context-based Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding (CABAC) as the entropy coding method. The CABAC has two main data processing paths: regular and bypass bin path, which can achieve good compression when used with Syntax Elements (SEs) statistics. However, it is highly intrinsic data dependence and has sequential coding characteristics. Thus, it is challenging to parallelize. In this work, a 6-core bypass bin path having high-throughput and low hardware area has been proposed. It is a parallel architecture capable of processing up to 6 bypass bins per clock cycle to improve throughput. Further, the resource-sharing techniques within the binarization and a common controller block have reduced the hardware area. The proposed architecture has been simulated, synthesized, and prototyped on 28 nm Artix 7 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The implementation of Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) has been done using 65 nm CMOS technology. The proposed design achieved a throughput of 1.26 Gbin/s at 210 MHz operating frequency with a low hardware area compared to existing architectures. This architecture also supports multi-standard (HEVC/VVC) encoders for Ultra High Definition (UHD) applications.",

		"Abstract": "The use of voltage differencing current conveyor as an active device to design a current-mode oscillator along with a universal filter with only grounded passive elements is the main focus of this manuscript. This re-arranging circuit can work as a sinusoidal oscillator as well as a current-mode universal filter, by simple selection of passive switches. Both the circuits employ only two active devices and three grounded passive elements. The designed oscillator provides two distinctive current outputs with a quadrature-phase difference. It also maintains an independent condition of oscillation and frequency of oscillation. Moreover, the basic responses including low pass, high pass, and band pass are easily available from a current-mode universal filter. The low input impedance and high output impedance are amongst the noteworthy features of the current-mode derived filter. Non-ideal, parasitic, and sensitivity analysis of the designed circuits are also incorporated in the manuscript. Cadence PSPICE software simulation results are also included to justify the design idea. Experimental implementation of the described circuit has also been shown by employing special-purpose amplifier integrated circuit, i.e., OPA860.",

		"Abstract": "There is a recent boom being witnessed in emerging areas like IoMT (Internet of Medical Things), Artificial Intelligence for healthcare, and disaster management. These novel research frontiers are critical in terms of hardware and cannot afford to compromise accuracy or reliability. Multiplier, being one of the most heavily used components, becomes crucial in these applications. If optimized, multipliers can impact the overall performance of the system. Thus, in this paper, an attempt has been made to determine the potential of accurate multipliers while meeting minimal hardware requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel Booth-Encoded Karatsuba multiplier and provide its comparison with a Booth-Encoded Wallace tree multiplier. These architectures have been developed using two types of Booth encoding: Radix-4 and Radix-8 for 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit multiplications. The algorithm is designed to be parameterizable to different bit widths, thereby offering higher flexibility. The proposed mul- tiplier offers advantage of enhanced performance with significant reduction in hardware while negligibly trad- ing off the Power Delay Product (PDP). It has been observed that the performance of the proposed architecture increases with increasing multiplier size due to significant reduction in hardware and slight increase in PDP. All the architectures have been implemented in Verilog HDL using Xilinx Vivado Design Suite.",

		"Abstract": "This paper deals with the design, simulation and real-time implementation of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) technique for a Photovoltaic (PV) system. A new modified Incremental Conductance (INC) algorithm is proposed to extract maximum power from PV panels at different levels of temperature and solar irradiation. The considered PV system consists of a PV panel, a DC-DC boost converter controlled by MPPT algorithm and a resistive load. First, the simulation tests of the proposed algorithm using Matlab/Simulink environment are presented, and then, followed by a real-time implementation using Arduino Mega board and a specific package known as ``Simulink support package for arduino hardware'' to validate experimentally the~simulation tests. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed modified INC algorithm offers much less oscillation around the Maximum Power Point (MPP), fast dynamic response and better performances compared to the conventional INC algorithm.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents a fuzzy system for reliability-based power distribution network planning. The proposed Mamdani type fuzzy inference system with subsequent application of the Bellman-Zadeh decision-making method is used to evaluate the reliability of the power line feeders as criteria for power system planning. Unplanned outages of system components, the Energy Not Supplied (ENS) and age of the power lines are used as input variables of the system and are fuzzified using triangular fuzzy functions. The proposed model was tested on a model of a realistic distribution network in order to prove its relevance and applicability. Results demonstrated that this model could make a contribution in this field as it can be used in practical planning situations for project priority ranking.",

		"Abstract": "Amongst many road lighting design criteria, energy performance plays an important role as it has a~direct link to operational costs, potential reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, mitigation of obtrusive light, and its impact on the night-time environment in urban and conurban settlements. The energy performance of road lighting is conveniently described by the pair of normative numerical indicators PDI and AECI established in European standards. This article aims to present typical values of these indicators for different combinations of road arrangements, road widths, lighting classes and light source technologies to illustrate what benchmarks can be expected using this assessment system. Objectives of the article also comprise discussion on factors influencing the energy performance and conclusion whether it is appropriate to introduce limiting value requirements and/or ranking systems to label energy performance of road lighting systems.",

		"Abstract": "A binary comparator architecture is proposed in this work for static logic to achieve both low-power and high-performance operations. It also presents a detailed timing performance and power analysis of various state-of-the-art comparator designs. The main advantages of this design are its high speed and power efficiency maintained over a wide range of operands size, which is useful at low-input data activity environments. The proposed circuit design uses minimum fan-in and fan-out logic gates for achieving high speed and low power dissipation. Utilizing a 2-bit binary comparator circuit with minimum fan-in and fan-out of logic gates (NAND-NOR), the architecture of a parallel binary comparator is proposed for higher input operands by using a low radix multiplexer and priority encoder. Further, to decrease the size of the multiplexer and priority encoder by two times, a general architecture is also proposed by using a 4-bit binary comparator to reduce its complexity. The proposed circuits are optimized in terms of the power consumption and delay, which are due to low load capacitance, low leakages, and reduced dynamic power dissipation. Each of the proposed circuits has its own merits in terms of speed, power consumption, Power-Delay Product (PDP). Its synthesis is done on 180 nm as well as 90 nm CMOS technology using the Cadence tool. The physical layout of the proposed architecture using a 90 nm CMOS process (GPDK process) is also obtained.",

		"Abstract": "Intrinsic resistivity of any semiconductor silicon layer strongly depends on dopants and impurities concentrations. Structural properties, treating, coating, finishing etc. affect dynamic resistance behaviour of a given p-n junction in a wafer. It is important for massively used photovoltaics, optoelectronics, microelectronics, and other solid-state electronics. In this work, efficient, universally applicable methodology is presented to investigate silicon resistive parameters. First, the silicon band gap models are studied. Influence of electrical resistivity on resistances and complex impedance parts is investigated. Dynamic iterative numerical modelling and simulations combined with sparse-matrix experimental measurements lead to extrapolated behaviours of these resistive parameters.

		"Abstract": "One of the most significant processes in micro- and nanoelectronics technology is Electron Beam Lithography (EBL). This technique maintains a leading role in extremely high-resolution structures fabrication process with micro- and nanometer dimensions down to dozens of nanometers. The EBL is a highly complex process and determining fundamental technological factors that affect the final pattern shape is crucial. One of them is the used lithography system, consisting of a substrate and a polymer layer that affects the electron scattering effects. To obtain the required pattern geometry, it is also necessary to properly select the electron beam parameters for given materials. The aim of this work is to discuss the differences in the exposition process for various accelerating voltage (EHT) values. Additionally, the investigation of geometry features and the impact of the exposure dose and the structure dimensions on the final absorbed energy distribution profile in the resist layer is presented and discussed. Numerical studies, using CASINO software and Monte Carlo method, are presented to compare the energy distribution in the polymer that affects the structure formation in the resist layer.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents a steady-state comparison of two methods that generate an orthogonal voltage system for a single-phase Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) structure:  a widely accepted one based on a Second Order Generalized Integrator (SOGI) and a new one based on a All-Pass Filter (APF) with Lattice structure. Both methods are very attractive because of their simple digital implementation, low computational load and good performance under harmonically distorted grid conditions and variable frequency, so they are a good alternative to other known methods. The paper derives and analyzes the full state space models of the two methods.It is shown that these two methods are equivalent in the most common operation conditions of distributed energy resources, although the APF structure is clearly better than the SOGI one because it maintains its orthogonal generation ability for any higher notch frequencies and any lower sampling frequencies. The comparative analysis were validated by simulation with MATLAB/Simulink and experimental results using a fixed-point DSP.",

		"Abstract": "This paper focuses on the investigation of the dynamic characteristics of Ultra High Voltage Direct Current (UHVDC) system Under Hierarchical Infeed Mode (UHVDC-HIM) with Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM). The STATCOM at the inverter side of UHVDC-HIM is developed in PSCAD/EMTDC, and their power flow equations are derived. Based on these equations, the control schemes for rectifier and inverter side of UHVDC-HIM and STATCOM are properly designed. Several dynamic characteristics indices such as Commutation Failure Immunity Index (CFII), Commutation Failure Probability Index (CFPI), fault recovery time and Temporary Overvoltage (TOV) are evaluated in detail. The impact of different sizes of STATCOM and Short Circuit Ratio (SCR) of AC sources on dynamic characteristics of UHVDC-HIM system during single-phase and three-phase faults are examined. The analysis shows that higher SCR values and greater capacity of STATCOM can make the UHVDC-HIM system less vulnerable to Commutation Failure (CF), considerably enhance the fault recovery time and effectively reduce the TOV.",

		"Abstract": "A promising technology for addressing network lifetime and energy bottlenecks in wireless networks is the Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT). In this paper, a Hybrid Time switching and Power splitting-based Relaying (HTPR) protocol for SWIPT in an Amplify-and-Forward (AF) network is proposed. The network consists of a source, relay, and destination in which the relay performs Energy Harvesting (EH) from the source signal and uses the harvested energy to transmit the signal to the destination. A direct link exists between the source and destination, and the signals from the source and relay are combined by the Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) method at the destination. Closed-form expressions for outage probability are derived under delay-limited transmission to determine the achievable throughput at the destination in different transmission schemes. For a constant data rate, HTPR protocol with uniform and optimal EH ratios are considered for throughput maximization. To solve the optimization problem, the convex optimization technique Lagrange multiplier method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are used. Results show that the HTPR protocol has higher throughput than other SWIPT protocols at relatively high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).",

		"Abstract": "This work proposes new control approaches for tracking and motion planning of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) that utilize skid steering system. This work proposes an energy based Variable Structure Control (VSC) scheme, in which two independent Sliding Control Surfaces (SCS)s are designed based on the system states. Particularly, the controller is designed based on the assessment and the minimization of the systems total energy by finding an explicit relation between the controller gains and the slope of the sliding surface. The work also discusses a new fuzzy potential approach for motion planning of UGV. The Fuzzy system generates an attractive force that pulls the UGV effectively toward a moving or stationary target, and a repulsive force, which is required to avoid any stationary or moving obstacles. Both, the VSC and the motion planning were validated by a nonlinear model of an Unmanned Tracked Robot (UTR) on different trajectories, and was compared with different control schemes. Simulation results show superiority of the proposed VSC over other methods with less control effort. Furthermore, the new motion planning controller proved its high capacity in producing a smooth and dynamic trajectory to allow an UGV to track a target and to avoid obstacles.",

		"Abstract": "With the growing demands of portable devices, it is necessary to pay attention to low-power digital integrated designs. This paper proposes a low-power MOS Current Mode Logic (MCML) design, termed as Hybrid Dynamic Current Mode Logic with modified current source (H-MDyCML). In H-MDyCML circuits, the functions are realized using complementary pass transistor logic which helps to overcome the problem of stacking of transistors in multiple levels. The dynamic current source has also been modified from an NMOS transistor to a PMOS transistor-driven current source which leads to the elimination of the use of CMOS inverter. H-MDyCML circuits are compared with other existing designing styles: Dynamic CML (DyCML), Hybrid DyCML (H-DyCML), and DyCML with modified current source (Dy-CML-NP). The proposed design (H-MDyCML) shows an overall improvement (in terms of Power Delay Product (PDP)) up to 94.77% compared to DyCML, 52.17% compared to Dy-CML-NP, and 91.40% compared to H-DyCML, for single stage circuits.",

		"Abstract": "Mobile health (mHealth) apps are increasingly adopted in healthcare domains, such as diabetes management, physical activity monitoring, and HIV treatment. However, mHealth app development is restricted due to healthcare privacy regulations, which require apps to handle collected data securely. The advent of online platforms, such as REDCap, alleviates this problem by providing privacy-compliant databases, so that mHealth apps developed for research groups can securely handle stored inactive data (data-at-rest) with fewer privacy concerns.\r\nUnfortunately, the authentication architectures of many online platforms do not meet the needs of mHealth apps and provide insufficient integration support. Assumptions made in other types of mobile apps about how users operate, such as a user's ability to type or remember a password, therefore may not be valid in the mHealth domain. \r\nTo address these problems this paper evaluates how authentication approaches impact the usability of mHealth apps. In particular, we present metrics to evaluate usability and show how the Proxy User Adapter pattern can integrate usability-enhanced authentication approaches to legacy secure database providers. We also propose a QR-Code authentication approach that applies the Proxy User Adapter pattern to help mHealth apps overcome common impediments, improve processing efficiency, and reduce potential mistakes caused by patients and providers alike.",

		"Abstract": "For the purpose of improving the service quality, video surveillance systems are widely used to standardize the service process in power supply business halls. If the employers check surveillance video to ensure predefined process of staff behaviours, it will be characterized as time-consuming. In recent years, great progress has been made in intelligent action recognition using Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). However, due to the small range of staffs' motion and similar scene information of power supply business halls, the performance of using traditional CNNs to recognize service actions, e.g. bowing, standing and sitting, is general. For improving the recognition rate, this paper proposes a 3D-fused Convolutional Network (ConvNet) for service actions recognition, which focuses on detecting the actions in the typical scene of one staff person and one customer with a well-segmented video clip. The well-segmented video clips are sent as input to the 3D-fused ConvNet for action recognition. The 3D-fused ConvNet consists of two base learners, optical flow base learner and RGB base learner. Both learners use the Convolutional 3D (C3D) architecture. Specifically, the RGB learner can be used to capture the features of small staffs' motion while the optical flow base learner can be viewed as the key part to eliminate the influence of the background, especially in a similar scene. Furthermore, prediction scores of two base learners can be weighted by the softmax function according to the performance of each base learner. Finally, the prediction scores of the two base learners are fused to obtain the prediction result, namely the specific actions of the staffs in the videos. The experiment result shows that the proposed method achieves 92.41% accuracy on the service action dataset of the power supply business hall.",

Hall Effect sensors have been used to obtain position data of the motor. Since Hall Effect sensors have been mounted, PMSM has been driven as a Brushless DC BLDC) motor. Sinusoidal and trapezoidal current reference models have been used in the control system. The proposed control system has been operated for speed control as well as position control of the motor. The developed genetic-based speed and position control method has been tested for both trapezoidal and sinusoidal PWM commutation techniques. The results obtained from these commutation techniques have been compared. Speed and position results of the motor have been obtained under the different load and operating conditions.

Also, an analytical method has been applied to infer the effects of DGs on the distribution systems\u2019 characteristics. The study also considers three types of DG modes, which are voltage control mode (PV mode), constant power mode (PQ mode), and also voltage control mode with reactive power constraint (PV mode with VAR constraint).

		"Abstract": "A single-tier downlink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) network is considered in this paper where analytical framework is given for performance evaluation. Particularly, the outage probability at the downlink users is studied under the impact of imperfect Channel State Information (CSI). The inter-cell interference and the intra-cell interference are also taken into consideration to capture practical behaviors of the proposed system. Further, we also adopt the Poisson Point Process (PPP) to model the location of the base stations and the downlink users in this work. For the imperfect CSI scenario, the results point out that the more times the user spends on performing interference cancellation, the more severe the user is affected by channel estimation error and vice versa. The results for the outage probability expressed in the analytical-forms are then confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulations.",

		"Abstract": "Objective quality assessment models have been used more and more in recent years to assess or monitor speech and audio quality in many multimedia and audio processing systems. These methods offer a clear and repeatable way to evaluate a customer experience by measuring perceived quality on a subjective scale, which is easily understood, such as a quality rating scale, ranging from excellent quality to a low quality. Subsequently, the aim of service providers is to offer reliable services providing the end-user/customer with the best possible quality in the context of the current network conditions to avoid a customer churn. This paper presents a design and performance evaluation of parametric models estimating the audio quality experienced by the end user of broadcasting systems and web-casting applications. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm is used to design non-intrusive parametric models, establishing the relationship between the feature description and the perceived quality scores. For this, the broadcast and web-cast sub-databases were created, where the web-cast sub-database includes 17.280 degraded samples and the broadcast sub-database contains 1080 degraded samples obtained from the Slovak Radio. The results reported for the proposed parametric audio quality models have validated Random Forest as a powerful technique that provides a good efficiency in terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).",

		"Abstract": "The design of transconductance-mode multifunction biquad filter containing three input voltage nodes and single-output current node is proposed. Its circuit principle is emphasized on employing Voltage Differencing Current Conveyor (VDCC) to be an active building block. The proposed filter description uses three VDCCs co-working with two grounded capacitors and three grounded resistors. The synthesis of the proposed multifunction filter is based on avoidance of using multiple-output active elements to achieve commercially available integrated circuits for practical implementation. Additionally, without multiple-output active element, it can alleviate current tracking error from the current mirrors used in output ports. It also decreases the amounts of the transistors inside the active elements. The proposed multifunction filter offers all 5 filter functions, which are non-inverting Low-Pass (LP), non-inverting High-Pass (HP), non-inverting Band-Pass (BP), non-inverting Band-Reject (BR) and also non-inverting All-Pass (AP) functions from same circuit topology under different circuit condition for input signals. Furthermore, the natural frequency for all filtering responses is independently achieved from the bandwidth or the quality factor of the proposed filter. For cascade-able connectivity, the output current port indeed provides a high impedance. In addition, the magnitude of the output current for all filtering functions can be resistively adjusted. The consideration for non-ideal case of the presented multifunction filter is also analyzed. The simulation and experimental results of the presented transconductance  multifunction biquad filter based on VDCC practically implemented by the commercially available ICs, LM13700 and AD844 can validate the theoretical anticipation.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, two circuits, namely Footer Voltage Controlled Dual Keeper domino logic (FVCDK) and Footer Voltage Controlled Dual Keeper with Static Switching domino logic (FVCDK-SS) are presented, in order to achieve high speed, low power consumption and robustness. The dual keeper arrangement helps in reducing the loop gain of the feedback circuitry, which leads to lower delay variability. The keeper circuitry is controlled using the footer voltage to reduce the contention current in the initial evaluation phase, and thus providing enhanced speed. In FVCDK-SS domino logic, unwanted transients at the output are reduced by incorporating pseudo-dynamic buffer in the proposed FVCDK domino logic. This further reduces the dynamic power consumption. The results of the logic presented here are validated by comparing them to a wide range of existing domino logic circuits for a~variety of performance metrics such as delay, power, power-delay product and unity noise gain. To effectively gauge the wide fan-in capabilities of the proposed logic, results are shown for the various fan-in OR gate. The simulations of the circuits are carried out using industry standard full-suite Cadence tools using 45~nm technology library.",

We consider a different number of bins and evaluated the similarity of the color content of images using mean square error of color histograms of a reference image and a searched image. Then, the color content of the image with the minimum error was the most similar to the reference image. We also used a parameter of variance, if the color content of several searched images was very similar based on the mean quadratic error for the structural descriptor.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents the comparative analysis of the three types of inverters which are Current-Fed Switched Inverter (CFSI), Trans-Current-Fed Switched Inverter (Trans-CFSI), and improved Switched Inductor-Quasi Switched Boosted Inverter (SL-QSBI). Also, a simple boost Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) Scheme is applied to CFSI, Trans-CFSI, and improved SL-QSBI. Each inverter category is analyzed separately for evaluating the effect of variation in duty ratio on the modulation index and boost factor. The comparisons of these inverters are rendered to quantify the voltage boost ability, voltage stress on the switching device and the voltage gain ability. Moreover, a simple boost control scheme is also modified to attain high modulation index. The efficacy of the proposed results is verified using the Saber software simulations.",

		"Abstract": "The DC-DC converter is majorly used in several renewable energy applications. It is usually relevant in a hard-switching operating mode at the cost of increasing power losses and declining efficiency. Power losses are comprised of switching losses and conduction losses, which affect the reliability and speed up the aging of the switch. Therefore, soft-switching techniques are inescapable to reduce electromagnetic interference EMI, minimize losses, and enhance power conversion efficiency. Among the sundry techniques of soft-switching, passive snubbers are uncomplicated and vigorous, besides it has been spotlighted as a finer alternative compared to the active snubbers that involve extra switches and an additional control circuit. This paper investigates the power loss of a conventional solar DC-DC static converter designed and controlled through Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). It evaluates the switch's temperature in the hard-switching operating mode. Besides, this paper presents a new research initiative that aims to allow a zero switching and stabilizing the temperature of the switch through a novel approach of design for RLD and RCD snubber cells. This new design allows the switch to achieve soft-switching, by abolishing the voltage stress, minimizing the power losses, and stabilizing the junction temperature. This snubber has a simple structure with a few components and ease of control, which helps to upgrade the power conversion efficiency through controlling the high voltage and current stress in the switch. In this treatise, elements of the snubber are designed and adjusted for maximum reliability through the simulation in OrCAD environment. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the model is approved through experimental results on a 1600 W conventional boost to validate the proposal.",

		"Abstract": "Historically, the negative effects of misalignment between the motor shaft and the load on the electric drives are well known. Vibrations, loss of life of couplings and deterioration of efficiency are some of these effects. Regarding this last point, the literature offers contradictory opinions. Some studies consider that the loss of efficiency in cases of misalignment is undesirable; while others consider that it has significant importance. In this paper, experimental results show in which cases the misalignment has a significant effect on efficiency and in which cases it can be neglected. For this, radial and angular misalignment cases are studied with four of the most used flexible couplings in the industry. The obtained results are analysed in relation to the actual regulations on energy efficiency in induction motors. The reached conclusions offer new tools for the correct selection of flexible couplings tending to the improvement of energy efficiency.",

		"Abstract": "The paper introduces a design of a nonlinear observer for the estimation of load torque of induction motors based on the output of the stator currents. The observer is built in the synchronous reference frame d-q with three main steps. First, the nonlinear observer for the class of non-affine control systems is reviewed. Second, the induction motor model is written in an appropriate form as a non-affine control system with canonical form for the design of the nonlinear observer. The system state is composed of the stator currents, speed and load torque. Based on the stator currents, the rotor flux leakages are  estimated via an open loop and used for the load torque observer. The observer is designed with a constant gain which is calculated by considering the trajectory of the rotor flux leakages. Both the load torque and rotor speed can be estimated by using the proposed observer.\r\nFinally, simulation and experiment are carried to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed observer.",

		"Abstract": "For designing power electronics, especially high-power-density systems, power loss estimation is a very important step in the design process. The estimation of losses without using a mathematical method, but instead using a simulation approach can significantly lower design time. In this paper, the estimation of the power losses by the simulation method using MATLAB Simulink is presented. The main goal of this paper is the estimation of the worst-case scenario of the inverter losses powering the three-phase asynchronous motor. Simulation is using real parameters of the used semiconductors to accurately estimate power losses. The simulation model consists of two main parts. The first one calculates power losses in semiconductors based on the provided parameters and his temperature. The second part calculates the temperature of the system based on the cooling model and losses calculated by the first system. Results in the form of the losses are used in the Fusion 360 software to simulate the temperature distribution of the heatsink. This simulation is supported by the calculation of the convection coefficient of the heatsink in different airflows. Additionally, two types of heat transfer were simulated, convection only and convection plus radiation type of heat dissipation.",

		"Abstract": "Single-Phase Phase-Locked Loops (PLL) have become a crucial component of grid-tied power converters. PLL accuracy and fast response are important for control and protection purposes, especially in the presence of voltage harmonics and frequency variations. In this paper, a new PLL structure based on an Adaptive Notch Filter (ANF) is presented. This ANF, which generates the orthogonal system of the PLL, is implemented with an All-Pass Filter (APF) having inherent advantages, such as low sensitivity to coefficient rounding when implemented in fixed-point microprocessors and easy implementation in a Digital Signal Processing (DSP). Both simulation with MATLAB/Simulink, and experimental results on a fixed-point DSP, are presented and analyzed to evaluate the performance of the introduced PLL and to support the theoretical development. A set of comparative simulations between the proposed PLL and a some single-phase PLL described in the literature are conducted to validate the method.",

		"Abstract": "The differential relaying scheme is universally adopted as the main protection for power transformer. In certain situations, like temporary over-fluxing, this differential protection may malfunction. This is due to unbalance in primary and secondary current, as the saturated core does not reflect equal ampere-turn on either side. This article presents detection of over-fluxing condition against the internal fault based on the fifth harmonic component of differential current. As per the estimated level of the fifth harmonic concerning the fundamental component of differential current, the pickup setting of percentage bias characteristic will be modified to avoid maloperation. Once the over-flux condition is sensed, the algorithm activates timer-based V/f protection to protect the equipment. The proposed algorithm is validated on PSCAD software and after the collection of data, MATLAB software is used for further validation. The proposed algorithm is validated under various test conditions like normal load, external fault, internal fault, and over-fluxing. It is observed that the algorithm accurately detects internal fault in the transformer or blocks the relay operation under momentary over-fluxing situations. Further, to assassinate the competency of the proposed scheme, a practical test is performed on a single-phase transformer available in laboratory. The data for various test cases are captured with the help of DSO, and the collected data has been migrated to computer where the proposed algorithm is examined. After analyzing all the results, it is cleared that the proposed algorithm can prevent transformer isolation during momentary over-fluxing conditions.",

The algorithm is used for making three days ahead prediction of energy for both generation and consumption in Estonia. A comparison is also made between our proposed algorithm and the forecasting algorithm used by Estonian energy regulatory authority.

SSR is defined as a condition wherein an electrical network exchanges energy with a turbine generator at one or more of the natural frequencies of the combined systems below its synchronous frequency. The presence of SSR in a system can lead to catastrophic outcomes, and the application of FACTS devices has been found to be one of the most effective approaches to reduce SSR. The study investigates the core concepts associated with FACTS devices and SSR. The concepts underlying SSR interactions, including self-excitation and transient torques, are examined in this study. The study also focuses on the use of FACTS devices in mitigating or eliminating SSR from the system or network of interest.

		"Abstract": "Speed governors have critical importance on hydroelectric power plants, which are adjusted to the rotating speed of hydroelectric generation based on load demand of the grid. The rotating speed is the main factor to balance power generation and load demand. The well-designed controller is needed to control speed governors with high accuracy. A well-defined model is needed to obtain desired control structure. Therefore, in this study, initially, the mathematical model of a hydroelectric power plant is obtained by using physical characteristics of a real-world. Then by using this model and corresponding real-world data, a set of controller parameters is designed by using tuning methodologies based on heuristic optimization algorithms, and their performances are compared with each other and with a classical tuning methodology. Evolutionary-based and nature-inspired-based heuristic optimization algorithms are selected as the tuning algorithms not only to compare the performance of these algorithms with a classical method but also with different origins. The performance of the optimized controller improves the performance of the overall system and helps to get desired performance. The results also indicate that as long as the desired performance criteria are defined as accurate as possible, the performance of the optimization algorithms is acceptable.",

		"Abstract": "The most common failure mode of aluminium electrolytic capacitor is the so-called wear out fault. It is caused by the high core temperature of the capacitor. Therefore, life cycle calculations generally use temperature data to estimate degradation level. Core temperature-based life cycle calculations can consider different current loads on capacitors. The calculation method uses scaling factors for different ripple current waveforms. However, it is not observed that temperature only is responsible for aging, but current waveform also influences the level of degradation. Therefore, sinusoidal and PWM-loaded capacitor tests were performed under the same temperature conditions. The results show that the pore distribution of aluminium anode foil has changed during the test. The pore diameter reduces and it leads to an increase in the ESR value and decrease in the capacitance, electrolyte amount and weight. Comparative results show that the PWM-loaded capacitor is more degraded than the capacitor loaded by sinusoidal test current.",

		"Abstract": "This paper shows the differences in luminous fluxes of two distinguishing dual-layer remote phosphor structures, Flat Dual-Remote Phosphor (FDRP) and Concave Dual-Remote Phosphor (CDRP). The impact of the distance between the two phosphor layers (d_1) and the distance from the phosphor layer to the LED surface (d_2) on the optical properties of the CDRP is also presented. Specifically, when d_1 and d_2 are varied, the scattering and absorption characteristics of the remote phosphor layer change dramatically, which enormously influences the color uniformity and illumination capability of WLEDs. The concentration of YAG:Ce3+ phosphor also needs to be modified so that the correlated color temperature of WLEDs could be maintained at 8500K when d_1 and d_2 are adjusted. In case d_1 = d_2 = 0, the scattering and absorption in the remote phosphor layer are minimal, leading to the infinitesimal color and luminous flux. When d_1 and d_2 get bigger, the scattering surface increases and that the blue and yellow rays are blended becomes more uniform, leading to the minimum white light deviation as well as the lowest luminous flux. According to the studied results, the lumen output can be maximum at 1020lm if d_1 = 0.08mm or d_2 = 0.63mm while the smallest color deviation occurs when d_1 = 0.64mm or d_2 = 1.35mm. Therefore, the researched results will provide further information for choosing the suitable d_1 and d_2 in order to improve the quality of WLEDs.",

		"Abstract": "From the perspective of renewable energy industry investment, absorbing maximum power from renewable sources is a vital factor. Hence, an algorithm is required to change the operating point of renewable energy sources in different environment conditions accordingly. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for tracking the Maximum Power Point (MPP) of a Photovoltaic (PV) panel. In this paper, an auxiliary parameter based on the voltage and power of the PV panel is suggested. By adopting this parameter, independence of irradiation and temperature, the interval between the operating point and the MPP can be estimated. Furthermore, the range of the MPP voltage variations is calculated with respect to various irradiations and temperatures. Then, a novel fuzzy logic Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm is proposed based on the introduced parameter and voltage variations interval of the MPP. The proposed algorithm has appropriate respond to environment condition changes with proper speed and accuracy. In addition, unlike Hill Climbing (HC) and Perturb and Observe (P&O), the proposed method has no chattering in steady state. The abovementioned claims are successfully validated via the software MATLAB/Simulink.",

		"Abstract": "Flywheel Energy Storage Systems (FESSs) are commonly integrated with wind farms to help them to provide many grid services, including frequency control, voltage control, and power smoothing. Although such systems are not concerned by the severe grid code requirements, their ability to ride-through voltage dips is important to ensure better stability of the power grid. In this paper, the authors propose a robust H\u221e current controller for a Wound Rotor Induction Machine (WRIM) based FESS during grid voltage dips. The proposed H\u221e controller decreases the negative effects of voltage dips in the WRIM system, such as the rotor over-currents and the active power oscillations. On the other hand, it also guarantees the robustness in the presence of parameter perturbation. The proposed controller is designed using a modified mixed-sensitivity H\u221e technique to take into consideration grid disturbances and parameter perturbation. Finally, simulations are made in MATLAB/Simulink using SimPowerSystems to verify the effectiveness of the H\u221e controller under grid voltage dips with WRIM parameter perturbation. The simulation results show that the proposed H\u221e controller can improve the stability of the WRIM based FESS subject to grid voltage dips and guarantee the robustness with parameter perturbation.",

		"Abstract": "The paper proposes a Fast ReRoute model with the realization of path and bandwidth protection scheme, which can be used in MPLS for SDN. The task of calculating the set of disjoint primary and backup paths during fast rerouting was reduced to solving the optimization problem of Integer Linear Programming. The advantage of the proposed solution is the possibility of implementing 1:1, 1:2, \u2026, 1:n path protection schemes without the introduction of an additional set of control (routing) variables, which contributes to reducing the dimension of the optimization problem being solved and the computational complexity of its practical implementation. The criterion of optimality of routing solutions contributes to the formation of the primary and backup disjoint paths with the highest possible bandwidth. In this case, the path with the maximum bandwidth will correspond to the primary path, while the remaining paths will be used as backup ones in decreasing order of their bandwidth. The total number of calculated disjoint paths depends on the selected redundancy scheme. The study conducted showed the efficiency and adequacy of the proposed Fast ReRoute model when using various redundancy schemes.",

		"Abstract": "The paper presents histogram-based initialzation of Fuzzy C Means (FCM) clustering algorithm for remote sensing image analysis. The drawback of well known FCM clustering is sensitive to the choice of initial cluster centers. In order to overcome this drawback, the proposed algorithm, first, determines the optimal initial cluster centers by maximizing the histogram-based weight function. By using these initial cluster centers, the given image is segmented using fuzzy clustering. The major contribution of the proposed method is the automatic initialization of the cluster centers and hence, the clustering performance is enhanced. Also, it is empirically free of experimentally set parameters. Experiments are performed on remote sensing images and cluster validity indices Davies-Bouldin, Partition index, Xie-Beni, Partition Coefficient and Partition Entropy are computed and compared with prominent methods such as FCM, K-Means, and automatic histogram based FCM. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed method is competent for remote sensing image segmentation.",

		"Abstract": "A simple Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) based on a standard single-mode fiber for simultaneous strain and temperature sensing was proposed and demonstrated experimentally. The interferometer was fabricated by electrical arc discharge method in which a portion of the standard single-mode fiber was heated and stretched. Any special type of fiber or a particular splicer was not required to form the MZI and it indicated high resolution. To find the modes that contributed to the interference spectrum, Fourier analysis was done and the spatial frequency versus normalized intensity plot showed that LP02 was the excited dominant higher order cladding mode. Coefficient matrix was realized for simultaneous measurement of strain and temperature ability of such an MZI. For discrete measurements, a resolution of 0.79 \u00b0C in temperature and 1.18 micro-strain can be achieved for 10 pm wavelength resolution. This extremely simple, low-cost sensor easily fabricated with good repeatability is a good candidate in diverse sensing applications.",

		"Abstract": "Z-source Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) inverter is a converter topology that combines the benefits of both the impedance network by storing temporary energy released to the load for voltage boosting and NPC inverter by guaranteeing lower Total Harmonic Distortions (THDs) and reducing voltage stresses of switching devices. In this context, this paper deals with a modified three-level Z-source NPC inverter topology with simplified command to generate shoot-through states and reduce switching losses. For this reason, an extra power switch Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) is added to insert shoot-through, thus eliminating the need for full-shoot-through on any of the three branches of the inverter. On the other hand, a modified Space Vector Modulation (SVM) strategy is proposed. This gives a number of benefits, both in terms of implementation and harmonic performance. Effectiveness of the proposed topology is verified through simulations using Matlab toolbox Simulation and laboratory experiment.",

		"Abstract": "Second-Order Generalized Integrator -- Frequency-Locked Loop (SOGI-FLL) is a popular technique available in the grid synchronization literature. This technique uses gain normalization in the frequency locked-loop. This increases the computational complexity. In this paper, we propose an alternative implementation to reduce the computational complexity of the SOGI-FLL. The proposed implementation modifies mainly the frequency locked-loop part and requires normalized voltage measurement. dSPACE 1104 board-based hardware implementation shows that the proposed implementation executes 20% faster than the standard implementation. This could be very beneficial for high switching frequency application e.g. >= 1MHz. In addition to the nominal frequency case, multi-resonant implementation is also proposed to tackle grid harmonics using a~simpler harmonic decoupling network. Small signal dynamical modeling and tuning are performed for both implementations. Dynamical equivalence is also established between the two implementations. Experimental comparative analysis demonstrates similar or better performance (depending on test scenarios) with respect to the standard implementation of the SOGI-FLL.",

		"Abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of Small Cell Cloud (SCC) composed of multiple Cloud-enabled Small Cells (CeSCs), which provide radio connection for mobile User Equipment (UE) such as smart-phones or wearables such as smart glasses. Moreover, CeSCs host computations offloaded from UEs in a way similar to centralized cloud, yet different in its proximity to users. Proposed client-server architecture of SCC conveys mechanisms for moving offloaded computations from the UEs to CeSCs. Real-life implementation of the SCC architecture relies on custom-developed Offloading Framework which is responsible for low-level communication between the UE and the SCC. The Offloading Framework is accompanied by an Augmented Reality (AR) app, which employs intensive computations for discovery of places of interest. Such app is latency-sensitive, a~criterion which makes computation offloading beneficial due to its ability to decrease latency. The combination of the Offloading Framework and the AR app makes up an SCC testbed used for further performance evaluation. Numerous measurements are carried out to examine the impact of various parameters. Based on Proof-of-concept implementation and thorough measurements, it has been revealed that computation offloading can decrease overall latency as much as to 47% and energy consumption on the UE side to 56%.",

		"Abstract": "Performance of Multicarrier Multicode Code-Division Multiple Access (MC/MCD-CDMA) systems can be improved significantly by using Wavelet Packets (WPs) as subcarriers instead of a~sinusoidal function. This is because WPs have much lower sidelobes and negligible sidelobe energy leakage compared to sinusoidal carriers; this property significantly decreases the intercarrier interference and improves the system performance. Further improvement can be achieved by utilizing multiple antennas at transmitter and receiver to construct a~Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system. Channel hardening is the main drawback of MIMO systems. Antenna selection can be employed to reduce this problem. In this paper, we use the antenna selection in MIMO WP-MC/MCD-CDMA system. These combinations of antenna selection, MIMO, and WP in MC/MCD-CDMA improve the system performance significantly and reduce the channel hardening. The performance of the system is tested according to the outage probability and bit error rate. Two MIMO schemes on Nakagami-m fading channel are considered, which are: selective transmit /selective receive and selective transmit /maximum ratio combining receive. The study includes the effects antennas' number, fading parameter-m, number of users, and the threshold signal to interferences plus noise ratio. The performance of the system is compared to that of MC/MCD-CDMA based on a~sinusoidal carrier. The results reveal that: by increasing antennas' number, the system performance is improved significantly, and MC/MCD-CDMA system based on WPs carriers outperforms MC/MCD-CDMA system based on a~sinusoidal carrier.",

		"Abstract": "Currently, dynamic comparator approach necessitates in high-speed and power efficient analog-to-digital converter applications due to its high latching speed and ultra-low power consumption. In this paper, a~novel dynamic comparator is proposed to reduce latch delay and offset. The comparator benefits from add-on cross-coupled transistors in latch structure and unbalanced clocks to enhance comparison speed and to lessen input offset voltage occurred due to mismatch in cross-coupled circuits in latch stage. The derivations for delay and input offset voltage are presented for proposed dynamic comparator with meticulous Monte-Carlo simulations. The results are verified by simulations in CADENCE SPECTRE at 1V supply voltage and 90nm CMOS technology. A~comparative analysis between the proposed dynamic comparator and the previous reported comparators has been presented. It is observed that the delay is reduced up to 46% and 6% as compared to conventional and two phase dynamic comparator, respectively. Moreover, the proposed design consumes 53.36muW power only. The Monte-Carlo simulation shows that the standard deviation of input offset voltage is 10.8~mV which is 12% and 77% of conventional and two phase dynamic comparator, respectively.",

		"Abstract": "This  paper presents the design and implementation of a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy controller for a DC-DC buck converter using  Arduino board.  The proposed fuzzy controller  is able to pilot the states of the buck converter to track a  reference model. The T-S fuzzy model is employed, firstly, to represent exactly the dynamics of the nonlinear buck converter system, and then the considered controller is designed on the basis of  a  concept called Virtual Desired Variables (VDVs). In this case, a two-stage design procedure is developed: i) determine the reference model according to the desired output voltage, ii) determine the fuzzy controller gains by solving a set of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). A digital implementation of the proposed T-S fuzzy controller is carried out using the ATmega328P-based Microcontroller of the Arduino Uno  board. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the  proposed control scheme.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents the research on the influence of coil parameter on the force of DC electromagnetic actuator. The coil parameter discussed in the paper is the angle between the windings. The research method is based on analyzing the magnetic path of DC electromagnetic actuator and on comparison of analytically obtained results with the numerical simulation results. Transient numerical simulation of DC electromagnetic actuator has been performed on the 2D axial-symmetric model using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The main contribution is the coil winding angle impact on the force of DC electromagnetic actuator. The results showed that, by reducing the coil winding angle, it is possible to increase the electromagnetic force, reduce the coil dimensions, and thus the dimensions of electromagnetic actuator.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents an improved single-phase Multilevel Inverter (MLI) which is conceptualized to reduce power switches along with separate DC voltage sources. Compared with recent modular topologies, the proposed MLI employs a reduced number of components. The proposed inverter consists of a combination of two circuits, i.e., the level generation and polarity generation parts. The level generation part is used to synthesize different output voltage levels, while the polarity inversion is performed by a~conventional H-bridge circuit. The performance of the proposed topology has been studied using s single-phase seven-level inverter, which utilizes seven power switches and three independent DC voltage sources. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is applied to inject a sinusoidal current into the utility grid which exhibits low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). Tests, including a~change in grid current amplitude as well as operation under variation in Power Factor (PF), have been performed to validate the good performance obtained using MPC. The effectiveness of the proposed seven-level inverter has been verified theoretically using MATLAB Simulink. In addition, Real-Time (RT) validation using the dSPACE-CP1103 has been performed to confirm the system performance and system operation using digital platforms. Simulation and RT results show improved THD at 1.23% of injected current.",

The comparison between shrinkage and least squares methods is studied and the advantages of the shrinkage methods are analyzed.

A TRMS serves  as a suitable laboratory-based  platform to evaluate the performance of control algorithms for  complex Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems such as rotocraft.\r\nIn the proposed scheme, an ISM enhancement to an LQG has been introduced, which attempts to overcome modelling inaccuracies and uncertainties. The novelty of the proposed control law lies in hybridizing a robust control approach with an optimal control law to achieve improved performance. Experimental results on the TRMS demonstrate that the ISM-LQG strategy significantly improves the tracking performance of the TRMS pitch and hence confirm the applicability and efficiency of the proposed scheme.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents utility for the design of the cross-coupled charge pump, which is used for supplying peripherals with low current consumption on the chip, as the EEPROM or FLASH memories. The article summarizes the knowledge in the field of the theoretical and practical analysis of the cross-coupled charge pump (design relationships and their connection with the pump parameters, as the threshold voltage, power supply voltage, clock signal frequency, etc.) that are applicated in the design algorithm. Optimal MOSFETs sizes (W, L) were find based on the construct of the time response characteristics of the pump sub-block and finding of the maximal voltage increase in the active interval of the clock signal and minimizing of the pump losses, as the switch reverse current, inverter cross current, etc. Synthesis process includes the design of the pump functional blocks with dominant real properties, which are described based on BSIM equations for long channel MOSFET. The pump stage complex model is applicated for estimation of the number of pump stages via state-space model description and using of the interpolation polynomial functions in the algorithm. It involves the construction of the time response characteristic due to the state variables and prediction of the number of the pump stages for the next cycle based on the previous data. Optimization of the pump area is based on the minimizing of the main capacitor in each of the pump stages (number of the pump stages must be increased to obtain the desired output voltage value.) Access is designed to stress the maximum pump voltage efficiency. The whole procedure is summarized in the practical example, in which the solution is shown both in terms of maximal voltage efficiency and the optimal pump area on a chip with respect to the clock signal frequency. Added functions of the design environment are explained, inclusive of the designed pump netlist generating for professional design environment Mentor Graphics including the real models of components that are available in library MGC Design Kit. The procedure gives designer credible results without long timeconsuming optimization process. In addition, the complex model allows the inclusion effects of higher-levels.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, standard ternary logic gates are initially designed to considerably reduce static power consumption. This study proposes novel ternary gates based on two supply voltages in which the direct current is eliminated and the leakage current is reduced considerably. In addition, ST-OR and ST-AND are generated directly instead of ST-NAND and ST-NOR. The proposed gates have a high noise margin near V_(DD)/4. The simulation results indicated that the power consumption and PDP underwent a~sharp decrease and noise margin showed a considerable increase in comparison to both one supply and two supply based designs in previous works. PDP is improved in the proposed OR, as compared to one supply and two supply based previous works about 83% and 63%, respectively. Also, a memory cell is designed using the proposed STI logic gate, which has a considerably lower static power to store logic \u20181\u2019 and the static noise margin, as compared to other designs.",

		"Abstract": "Heart disease classification plays an important role in clinical diagnoses. The performance improvement of an Electrocardiogram classifier is therefore of great relevance, but it is a challenging task too. This paper proposes a novel classification algorithm using the kernel method. A kernel is constructed based on wavelet coefficients of heartbeat signals for a classifier with high performance. In particular, a wavelet packet decomposition algorithm is applied to heartbeat signals to obtain the Approximation and Detail coefficients, which are used to calculate the parameters of the kernel. A principal component analysis algorithm with the wavelet-based kernel is employed to choose the main features of the heartbeat signals for the input of the classifier. In addition, a neural network with three hidden layers in the classifier is utilized for classifying five types of heart disease. The electrocardiogram signals in nine patients obtained from the MIT-BIH database are used to test the proposed classifier. In order to evaluate the performance of the classifier, a multi-class confusion matrix is applied to produce the performance indexes, including the Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1 score. The experimental results show that the proposed method gives good results for the classification of the five mentioned types of heart disease.",

Our method is non-iterative, finding an optimal transformation in a single step, in a time proportional only to a number of the corresponding line segments. The procedure also provides diagnostic measures of reliability of the computation and of similarity of the data sets being registered. At this point, the method presumes known correspondences, which is limiting, but the discussion, in the end, reveals some possibilities to overcome this issue. Practical properties are demonstrated on a typical task of localization of a robot with a known map.",

		"Abstract": "The main objective for a watermarking technique is to attain imperceptibility, robustness and security against various malicious attacks applied by illicit users. To fulfil these basic requirements for a scheme is a big issue of concern. So, in this paper, a new image watermarking method is proposed which utilizes properties of homomorphic transform, Redundant Discrete Wavelet Transform (RDWT), Arnold Transform (AT) along with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to attain these required properties. RDWT is performed on host image to achieve LL subband. This LL subband image is further decomposed into illumination and reflectance components by homomorphic transform. In order to strengthen security of proposed scheme, AT is used to scramble watermark. This scrambled watermark is embedded with Singular Values (SVs) of reflectance component which are obtained by applying SVD to it. Since reflectance component contains important features of image, therefore, embedding of watermark in this part provides excellent imperceptibility. Proposed scheme is comprehensively examined against different attacks like scaling, shearing etc. for its robustness. Comparative study with other prevailing algorithms clearly reveals superiority of proposed scheme in terms of robustness and imperceptibility.",

At first, we investigated diffraction properties of woodpile structure with a period of 2 \u03bcm. The structure was placed on a glass substrate, and diffraction patterns were measured using laser sources with different wavelengths. After diffraction properties investigation, the fabricated structures were used in optoelectronic devices by their surface application. Our polymer 3D PhC woodpile structures were used for radiation properties modification of light emitting devices - optical fiber and Light Emitting Diode (LED) and for angular photoresponse modification of InGaAsN-based photodiode. The modification of the far-field radiation patterns of optical fiber and LED and spatial modulation of light coupling into photodiode chip with applied structures were measured by goniophotometer.

		"Abstract": "A novel control DC-DC-AC buck converter for single phase capacitor-start-run induction motor drives is presented in this paper. The objective is to minimize harmonic distortion in inverter output voltage supply to a Single Phase Induction Motor (SPIM). Here, the output of a variable duty cycle buck DC-DC converter is fed to an H-bridge inverter to generate a very close sinusoidal output voltage. Few power semiconductor switches are utilized to produce inverter output voltage with reduced harmonic distortion comparable with results achieved in multilevel inverters. The SPIM was analysed in the stationary d-q reference frame while the buck converter was operated in the Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) to ensure that the output voltage vary exactly as the duty cycle. The simulation results show good starting transient characteristics for the SPIM and also stable operation under intermittent loading of 4 N-m. The average inverter output voltage of 157.4 V was achieved with Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) as low as 6.32%. This configuration is simple, cheap, and has reduced control complexity.",

		"Abstract": "This paper proposes optimal designs of three closed rotor slots geometries for reducing the rotor leakage reactance and increasing the starting performance of high-speed spindle motors. The optimal designs were developed using the response surface methodology and Finite Element Method (FEM). Three closed rotor slot geometries, namely closed, round, and oval were investigated through FEM calculation and validated by experimental measurement for improving starting performance parameters such as starting current, starting torque, magnetic flux linkage in starting condition, and efficiency. In this study, a starting performance analysis, including the alternative equivalent circuit method and flux linkage FEM analysis, was employed. The results show that among the three slot geometries, the optimal design of the circular closed rotor slot produces the lowest rotor leakage reactance and the highest magnetic flux linkage, starting torque, and efficiency. A comparison between the simulation and experimental results validated the accuracy of the proposed model with percentage error being approximately 8%.",

		"Abstract": "In the recent years, several research works are focusing on the use of STATCOM in electrical networks because it is used to regulate the voltage, to improve the dynamic stability of the power system besides allowing better management of the power flow. All these positive tasks have guaranteed an important position of STATCOM within a family of Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS). In this paper study, the control and operation of a three levels 48-pulse GTO based STATCOM is implemented with series connected transformers. The system may, unfortunately, be prone to GTO switch faults and therefore may affect reactive power transiting. In this paper, a new diagnostic approach is proposed based on the Single-Sided Amplitude Spectrum (SSAS) method of the three-leg converter currents for detection and localization of open-circuit faults. The integration of the STATCOM reconfigurable fault tolerant to the system is also considered to ensure service continuity. Several results are presented and discussed in this paper to illustrate the performance of the STATCOM fault-tolerant diagnostic.",

		"Abstract": "Passive methods of islanding detection have the advantage of not perturbing the system, but they suffer from large Non-Detection Zone (NDZ) and unpredictable detection time. In this paper, a new passive scheme for islanding detection, based on estimating a new index derived from summation of impedance values in all frequencies along the time at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC), is introduced using Fast Discrete S-Transform (FDST) method. The proposed method maintains both time and frequency information and as a result, helps to decrease the detection time. A frequency dependent model is proposed for characterizing the interconnection changes when islanding happens. The Cumulative Impedance Index (CII) is proposed to discriminate between islanding condition and normal operation. This technique is combined with under/over voltage protection method to decrease NDZ. Simulations for different conditions of normal and islanding operations verify the proposed algorithm. In all cases, islanding is detected within 0.01 s, and NDZ is decreased to 1% of power mismatch between local load and Distributed Generator (DG) output. The results demonstrate the capability of the method to islanding detection with minimum delay and least NDZ.",

		"Abstract": "Probe-fed hexagonal patch antenna suffers from impedance mismatch especially when feed is located at one of the vertices of polygon. Hexagonal planar antennas also suffer from high cross polar levels. This paper proposes a method to overcome impedance mismatch and to increase co-polarization level by reducing ground plane. Vertex feeding is demonstrated in this paper to establish improvement in impedance values more clearly. The impedance at any vertex of a hexagonal patch is too high when compared to the characteristic impedance of the probe. Three vertex-fed hexagonal antennas are developed to demonstrate the effect of ground plane reduction within C-Band. The proposed technique can be optimized to match the impedance and achieve good return loss where monopole radiation characteristics are not an issue. A vertex-fed reduced ground hexagonal antenna is proposed here that operates around 5 GHz with a frequency span of 600 MHz. Thus, the proposed antenna is quite suitable for indoor wireless LAN (UNII-1) applications.",

		"Abstract": "When it comes to indoor Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) for an Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV), the most important factor is to minimize the location estimation error. In industrial sites, centimetre-level accuracy is required for the AGV. Since the duration for measuring the position of an AGV is slower than the speed of arriving RF signals, the margin of error inevitably becomes larger than in systems that use low-speed media such as ultrasonic waves. To minimize such errors, a short-range location estimation Recursive RF Active Echo (RRFAE) algorithm is presented. Increasing the time ratio by repeatedly and interactively reflecting the signal can reduce measurement error. That is, there is an effect of expanding the measurement distance by the number of iterations. We propose and implement a precise positioning algorithm in an indoor environment where many reflections exist. The error analysis of the RRFAE algorithm after hardware correction shows that the level of the RRFAE's errors is only one tenth that of an RTLS system that uses other RF signals.",

		"Abstract": "Design, realization and performance evaluation of fractional order high pass filter based on Operational Transresistance Amplifier (OTRA) using three fractional elements of different order \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are presented in this paper. The projected circuit uses a single active current mode device i.e. OTRA and utilizes fractional capacitors of varying orders to boost the design flexibility. The design equations for fractional order high pass filter are computed from the transfer function. The paper elaborates the impact of fractional order elements of varying order on the frequency response of the filter. Subsequently, the sensitivity and stability of the transfer function of the proposed filter are also analyzed. The potential usefulness of the proposed filter is additionally incontestable through the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR), Temperature sweep, Corner, Supply Voltage variation and Noise Analysis. It has been observed that the proposed  pass filter in fractional domain supported OTRA provides greater flexibility in controlling the magnitude characteristics.",

		"Abstract": "A Sub-1V, MOS-only Voltage Reference Circuit (VRC) has been proposed with the utmost of transistors working as subthreshold region for low-supply and low-power applications. A supply-insensitive current is passed to Active Load Circuit (ALC) for supply and temperature independence at the output reference voltage. It has four current mirrors connected in a closed loop configuration to generate a supply-independent current which is passed through the ALC resulting supply and temperature insensitive output reference voltage. The ALC has a combination of two subthreshold NMOS transistors having different threshold voltages. The presented VRC is simulated using standard 90 nm CMOS model for 0.25-1 V supply voltage range. The simulation result gives minimum operating voltage required as 0.25 V for which all transistors work in their respective region of operation. For the supply range of 0.25-1 V, the obtained mean voltage reference is 100.4 mV with the line regulation of 0.186 mV/V. The temperature coefficient (TC) of 51ppm/\u00b0C is achieved for a wide temperature range of -50 to 135\u00b0C with the given minimal operating supply voltage. The power dissipation for minimal supply voltage at room temperature is 33 nW. The proposed VRC exhibits a high PSRR of -52.5 dB at 100Hz and -29 dB at 1 MHz.",

		"Abstract": "The objective of this work is to propose a modified Min-Sum decoding Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) algorithm and perform the hardware implementation analysis of Min-Sum, optimized Min-Sum and modified Min-Sum decoders. The Min-Sum algorithm mainly uses the process of finding the minimum and addition. Hence the number of multiplications is drastically reduced which helps in reducing the complexity of implementation. Adding an optimisation factor to the decoder increases the accuracy and reduces the number of iterations required to compute the decoded message. Hence the process of optimisation reduces the overall decoding time required. Modified Min-Sum algorithm is proposed to further improve the performance by decreasing the number of stages in the decoding process which reduces the complexity in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation.",

		"Abstract": "Clinical retinal image analysis is an import aspect of clinical diagnosis in ophthalmology. Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) represents one of the most severe retinal disorders in prematurely born infants. One of the ROP clinical signs is the presence of retinal lesions endangering the vision system. Unfortunately, the stage and progress of these findings is often only subjectively estimated. A procedure such as this is undoubtedly linked to subjective inaccuracies depending on the experience of the ophthalmologist. In our study, a fully autonomous segmentation algorithm to model retinal lesions found using RetCam 3 is proposed. The proposed method used a combination of retinal image preprocessing and active contours for retinal lesion segmentation. Based on this procedure, a binary model of retinal lesions that allowed retinal lesions to be classified from a retinal image background was obtained. Another important aspect of the model was feature extraction. These features reliably and automatically described the development stage of an individual lesion. A complex procedure such as this has significant implications for ophthalmic clinical practice in substituting manual clinical procedures and improving the accuracy of routine clinical decisions.",

This assessment is based on code analysis focused mainly on the error probability calculation. The results published in the practical part are obtained using a model created in Matlab environment, in which the chosen convolutional structures were tested. These tests were focused on the transmission error probability analysis provided by a binary symmetric channel, and also on optimization of other parameters affecting the residual error in the decoding algorithm.

		"Abstract": "In comparison with the conformal phosphor or in-cup phosphor structure, remote phosphor structure has a superior luminous flux whereas its color quality is inferior to the others\u2019. Due to this drawback, it is essential to conduct experiments to find the solution for the improvement of the color quality of WLEDs using remote phosphor structure. In this study, a dual-layer remote phosphor structure that is capable of enhancing the Color Rendering Index (CRI) and Color Quality Scale (CQS) for WLEDs was proposed. Three kinds of WLEDs with the similar structures but different color temperatures varying at 5600 K, 7000 K, and 8500 K are used in this article. The mission of this paper is to place a yellow-green emitting SrBaSiO4:Eu2+ phosphor layer or a red-emitting SrwFxByOz:Eu2+,Sm2+ phosphor layer on the YAG:Ce3+ phosphor layer and then select the most appropriate value of SrwFxByOz:Eu2+,Sm2+ concentration to get the greatest color quality. Experimental results were exactly as expected since SrwFxByOz:Eu2+,Sm2+ really succeeded in increasing CRI and CQS. Specifically, the larger the SrwFxByOz:Eu2+,Sm2+ concentration, the higher the CRI and CQS, resulting from the increase of the red light component in WLEDs. Meanwhile, the quality degree of luminous flux depends tightly on the SrBaSiO4:Eu2+ phosphor layer. However, if the SrwFxByOz:Eu2+,Sm2+ and SrBaSiO4:Eu2+ concentration exceeds, the luminous flux and color quality will have a tendency to drop off thanks to the theory of Mie scattering and the Lambert-Beer law. The result of this paper is a valuable reference in the production of high-quality WLEDs.",

		"Abstract": "This study presents a filterless and sensorless commutation method for low-voltage brushless DC motors. The proposed method utilizes controlled DC-link inverter instead of the Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) scheme. Therefore, motor voltages and currents become free from the high-frequency noise of PWM switching, thereby decreasing motor losses. Consequently, the method does not require any Low-Pass Filter (LPF) and it does not involve speed-dependent phase delay caused by the LPF. However, current commutation deteriorates waveform of line voltages. Thus, specific functions are defined to compensate for the current commutation spikes and remove false zero-crossing points of line voltages. Furthermore, the use of unfiltered line voltages eliminates the requirement of any phase shifter. Hence, the main superiority of the proposed method over preceding sensorless commutation methods is the simultaneous elimination of the phase shifter and LPF, which makes the method simple and cost-effective. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness and validity of the method.",

		"Abstract": "This paper addresses the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem in DC power microgrids via a combinatorial optimization technique known as Black Hole Optimization (BHO). Such optimization method allows to solve OPF problems via algorithmic strategies trough a master-slave formulation. In the master stage, the total power generated by each Distributed Generator (DG) is determined by the BHO, while the slave strategy is entrusted with solving the resulting conventional power flow problem via a classical Gauss-Seidel (GS) numerical method. For comparison purposes, this work uses nonlinear optimization methods available in General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) as well as continuous metaheuristic optimization techniques. Two test feeders with 21 and 69 nodes were considered for validating the proposed hybrid BHO-GS optimization method, which enables to demonstrate its applicability, robustness and efficiency compared to conventional approaches. The results of all the simulations were obtained via MATLAB 2017a.",

		"Abstract": "Discovering periodic patterns in a customer transaction database is the task of identifying itemsets (sets of items or values) that periodically appear in a sequence of transactions. \r\nNumerous methods can identify patterns exhibiting a periodic behavior. Nonetheless, a problem of these traditional approaches is that the concept of periodic behavior is defined very strictly. Indeed, a pattern is considered to be periodic if the amount of time or number of transactions between all pairs of its consecutive occurrences is less than a fixed maxPer (maximum periodicity) threshold. As a result, a pattern can be eliminated by a traditional algorithm for mining periodic patterns even if all of its periods but one respect the maxPer constraint. Consequently, many patterns that are almost always periodic are not presented to the user. But these patterns could be considered as interesting as they generally appear periodically. To address this issue, this paper suggests to use three measures to identify periodic patterns. These measures are named average, maximum and minimum periodicity, respectively. They are each designed to evaluate a different aspect of the periodic behavior of patterns. By using them together in a novel algorithm called  Periodic Frequent Pattern Miner, more flexibility is given to users to select patterns meeting specific periodic requirements. The designed algorithm has been evaluated on several datasets. Results show that the proposed solution is scalable, efficient, and can identify a small sets of patterns compared to the Eclat algorithm for mining all frequent patterns in a database.",

		"Abstract": "This study is related to SLAM, also known simultaneous localization and mapping which is highly important and an indispensable issue for autonomous mobile robots. Both an environment mapping and an agent\u2019s localization are provided with SLAM systems. However, while performing SLAM for an unknown environment, the robot is navigated by three different ways: a user guidance, random movements on an exploration mode or exploration algorithms. A user guidance or random exploration methods have some drawbacks that a user may not be able to observe the agent or random process may take a long time. In order to answer these problems, it is searched for a new and autonomous exploration algorithm for SLAM systems. In this manner, a new kind of left-orientated autonomous exploration algorithm for SLAM systems has been improved. To show the algorithm effectiveness, a factory-like environment is made up on the ROS (Robot Operating System) platform and navigation of the agent is observed. The result of the study demonstrates that it is possible to perform SLAM autonomously in any similar environment without the need of the user interference.",

		"Abstract": "Children suffering from asthma are often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as their symptoms are similar to other respiratory conditions. Spirometry, the \"golden\" pulmonary function test used for asthma diagnosis, is often unsuitable for young children since it requires them to perform extreme inhalation and exhalation maneuvers. Impulse Oscillometry (IOS) is an effortless, child-friendly, sensitive, and reliable testing technique that could be used in the effective diagnosis of asthma. However, the IOS requires a deep understanding of the mechanical and/or equivalent electrical circuit models of the human respiratory system, which hinders its broad acceptance and utility in clinics. This paper presents a data characterization study based on the statistical assessment of the IOS parameters. The main focus is to investigate four different manifestations of pulmonary conditions in children due to peripheral obstruction: Asthma (A), Small Airway Impairment (SAI), Possible Small Airway Impairment (PSAI), and Normal (N). The objective of this investigation is to pave the way for the feature selection stage of our future computer-aided classification work to distinguish between lung dysfunction and healthy lung function in children by identifying those IOS parameters that are most sensitive to discriminate between the different respiratory conditions mentioned above. Our ultimate goal is to facilitate the interpretation of the impulse oscillometric test results and provide clinicians with a reliable and proven method for accurate classification of children's lung function for an early asthma detection, diagnosis, and control.",

		"Abstract": "Visible Light Communication (VLC) technology uses white Light Emitting Diodes (LED) for providing illumination and communication at the same time. White LEDs have excellent illumination properties but their communication properties need improvement. This article proposes a way how to evade the communication limitations of white LEDs. A part of original white LED spectrum is suppressed by an optical filter. Then the suppressed part is replaced by another LED. The correct choice of suitable LED enables to reconstruct the original spectrum. This solution removes the limitations because the white LED emits continuously. Data are carried by the communication LED only. The evaluation of reconstruction of original white light is measurement of the colour coordinates x and y. Furthermore, the communication properties of this transmitter were tested and obtained results are shown in this paper. EVM parameter was measured.",

		"Abstract": "One of the crucial goals often thought of in connection with remote phosphors is to make the emitted photon larger than other structures. However, the two biggest hurdles that make achieving the goals more challenging are color uniformity and Color Rendering Index (CRI). This is the reason why people have started to pay more attention to these issues in recent research papers. Thus, this study will present the idea of controlling the distance between phosphor layers to control the optical parameters of White light LED (WLED). Based on the Mie scattering theory, which is about absorption and scattering of plane electromagnetic waves by uniform isotropic particles of the simplest form (sphere, infinite cylinder) which are in a uniform and isotropic dielectric infinite medium, the results of the study are confirmed to be completely accurate and reliable. Specifically, when d = 0.64 mm, the flux can increase to 9.7% compared to the original. Similarly, when d = 0.84 mm, the color uniformity can be double better meanwhile the CRI value is kept intact. Once fully calculated and substantiated, the paper will provide comparable results in practice for the production of higher quality WLED.",

		"Abstract": "Clean energy sources like wind energy have received great attention due to growing demand for electrical energy and increase of environmental pollution. The Doubly Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs) are also in common use due to their ability to control the reactive power with no need for capacitor banks. Existence of active and reactive power controllers in DFIG may provide the possibility of adverse interaction with torsional modes of the turbine-generator set. Because of the importance of this phenomenon, in this paper, the interaction of DFIG controllers with other components of the wind turbine-generator, especially torsional modes, has been studied. As the variable speed wind turbine is used, the effects of rotor speed variation on the torsional interaction with the active and reactive power controllers have been investigated. Moreover, the effects of variation of other parameters such as local load, and mechanical and electrical parameters of DFIG on the torsional interaction have been studied. In order to study and analyze this phenomenon, the linear modal analysis is used. The obtained results demonstrate the effects of parameters in possible occurrence of interaction between the DFIG controllers and the DFIG turbine generator set. In addition, the obtained analytical results are verified via time domain simulation.",

A new robust control has been proposed and utilized to operate the wind turbine so as to extract the maximum power from the wind energy and to ensure a unit power factor. This control is known as the Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) and it is based on the Extended State Observer (ESO). It consists in controlling, through the stator currents, the machine side converter in order to adapt the rotational speed of the generator to the different wind speed profiles (Maximum Power Point Tracking MPPT). In addition, it ensures the control of the DC bus voltage and the exchange of active and reactive powers between the wind turbine and the electrical power grid. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed control a series of simulations are made under the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The results obtained by simulation show that the proposed strategy is efficient in terms of stability and precision as well as for the robustness with regard to the internal disturbances when variying the parameters of the machine.",

		"Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to describe development of a new control structure for Automatic Voltage Regulator system. This approach is based on the optimization of the control voltage magnitude of a brushless excitation synchronous alternator machine operating at variable speed. The choice of the machine type is justified by its attractiveness in several areas such as the aircraft domain due to its autonomy and robustness. The considered control technique is based on the simultaneous optimization of two regulators introduced in the loop control. The parameters of the Proportional Integral Derivatives (PID) regulator have been optimized using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which is considered as an attractive method considering the wide operating speed range, and the load variations compared with the classical methods such as Ziegler Nichols. Many robustness tests are carried out by considering the parameters variations as well as the perturbation connection and disconnection of the load at low and high speeds.",

		"Abstract": "Most existing Second Order Sliding Mode Control (SOSMC) approaches are achieved under assumptions that 1) all of state variables must be accessible; 2) the second derivative of all state variables must exist, even though mathematical model of systems uses the first order equations. In this paper, a new adaptive SOSMC scheme is proposed for mismatched uncertain systems in which these above assumptions are required. In this proposed method, only output variables are used in the sliding surface and controller design. The advantage of no need of all state variables in controller design makes the method more useful and realistic since it can be applied to a wider class of systems. Finally, a vertical take-off and landing aircraft at the nominal airspeed of 135~knots is simulated to demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

		"Abstract": "Dynamic Economic Dispatch (DED) is a highly complex nonlinear optimization problem with practical constraints. The aim of DED is to optimize dynamically the active power of generating units over operating time considering practical constraints such as valve point effect, prohibited zones, ramp rate limits and total power losses. In order to overcome the drawback of the two standard metaheuristics such as Firefly Algorithm (FA) and Time Varying Acceleration based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSOTVAC), a hybrid method called FAPSOTVAC is proposed to improve the solution of DED. The main idea introduced towards combining FA and PSOTVAC is to create a flexible equilibrium between exploration and exploitation during search process. The robustness of the proposed hybrid method is validated on many practical power systems (10 and 30 units) to minimize the total fuel cost considering all practical constraints. The results found prove the efficiency of the proposed FAPSOTVAC in terms of solution quality and convergence characteristics.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, an efficient Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) search algorithm is presented for solving the optimal power flow problem in a power system, enhanced by wind power plant. The GWO algorithm is based on meta-heuristic method, and it has been proven to give very competitive results in different optimization problems. First, by using the proposed technique, the system independent variables such as the generators\u2019 power outputs as well as the associated dependent variables like the bus voltage magnitudes, transformer tap setting and shunt VAR compensators values are optimized to meet the power system operation requirements. The Optimal power flow study is then performed to assess the impact of variable wind power generation on system parameters. Two standard power systems IEEE30 and IEEE57 are used to test and verify the effectiveness of the proposed GWO method. The obtained results are then compared with others given by available optimization methods in the literature. The outcome of the comparison proved the superiority of the GWO algorithm over other meta-heuristics techniques such as Modified Differential Evolution (MDE), Enhanced Genetic Algorithm (EGA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO), Artificial Bee Algorithm (ABC) and Tree-Seed Algorithm (TSA).",

		"Abstract": "To improve the throughput and the outage probability of the Cognitive Radio (CR) inspired system, a novel Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) can be deployed to adapt multiple services in 5G wireless communication. In this scheme, after the reception of the superposition coded symbol with a predefined power allocation factors from the primary source, the relay decodes and forwards with a new superposition coded symbol (i.e. allocating another power factors) to the destination. By employing twin antenna design at the relay, the bandwidth efficiency in such scheme will be improved. Assuming Rayleigh fading channels, the closed-form expressions in terms of throughput and the outage performance are derived. Through numerical results, they showed that the outage performance of the proposed scheme using a Single Antenna (SA) scheme at the relay is better than a Twin Antenna (TA) scheme because SA scheme is not affected by its own antenna interference.",

		"Abstract": "The Error Correction Code (ECC) is utilized to reduce the probability of error in digital systems. The binary Golay code is an ECC that can correct any combination of three or fewer random errors over a block of 23 digits. This code can be extended by appending a parity check bit to each codeword. There are several algorithms for constructing of Golay code, but more of them are not comfortable for hardware implementation. In this paper, an efficient hardware architecture is presented for the encoder of both binary Golay code and extended Golay code based on CRC. The proposed Golay code encoder is constructed of three units, which are designed carefully: data path, control unit and conversion unit. The proposed architecture is implemented on FPGA using Xilinx ISE 14.2. The implementation results demonstrate that low latency, high throughput, low area and less complexity are the advantages of this architecture compared to previous architectures. Thus, this hardware module can be used for high-speed digital systems.",

This work introduces an alternative approach suitable for miniaturized sensors with low inter-electrode separation and electrodes fixed to the sensor encapsulation. Application of amplitude EDR algorithm on single-lead wireless sensor system with optimized electrode positions shows results comparable with standard robust systems. The modified method can be applied in daily physiological monitoring, in sleep studies or implemented in smart clothes when standard respiration techniques are not suitable.",

		"Abstract": "The diagnosis of UltraSound (US) medical images is affected due to the presence of speckle noise. This noise degrades the diagnostic quality of US images by reducing small details and edges present in the image.  This paper presents a novel method based on shearlet coefficients modeling of log-transformed US images. Noise-free log-transformed coefficients are modeled as Nakagami distribution and speckle noise coefficients are modeled as Gaussian distribution. Method of Log Cumulants (MoLC) and Method of Moments (MoM) are used for parameter estimation of Nakagami distribution and noise free shearlet coefficients respectively. Then noise free shearlet coefficients are obtained using Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) estimation of noisy coefficients. The experimental results were presented by performing various experiments on synthetic and real US images. Subjective and objective quality assessment of the proposed method is presented and is compared with six other existing methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method over other methods can be seen from the obtained results.",

		"Abstract": "The paper deals with a novel enhanced connection of AC/AC powertrain for Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV). The substantial contribution of such a connection is the absence of 4QC auxiliary converter needed for autonomous and hybrid operational modes and its compensation by power-lesser 0x5 matrix converter. The main advantages of a simplified connection are, beside smaller auxiliary converter sizing, also possible better efficiency of the HEV powertrain. So, powertrain operation in autonomous traction accu-battery modes uses direct 0x5 configuration of traction 3x5 MxC matrix converter, and in hybrid modes of Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and accu-battery uses besides traction 3x5 MxC matrix converter the auxiliary 0x5 matrix converter. Modeling and simulation using Matlab-Simulink environment of traction powertrain configuration in autonomous modes are presented in the paper as well as all simulation experiment results.",

		"Abstract": "Development of electric drive tends to the use of Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) for their advantages and green technology issues. The SRM takes significant place in development for its simplicity, robust construction, and low cost. Sensorless method can be applied to drive SRM, it is less expansive but has more complexity and limitation. On the other hand, although sensor-based rotor position detection needs a hardware assembled on the shaft, some advantages can be obtained. In this paper, a control strategy for SRM drive with rotary encoder based rotor position detection is proposed, core of the strategy implements digital signal controller. The problem associated with wide range speed and standstill operation can be overcome by this strategy. This is also capable to vary the time to turn the switches on and off by software.

		"Abstract": "The disturbances are the significant issue for the trajectory tracking of mobile robots. Therefore, an adequate control law is presented in this paper and this one is based on Global Terminal Sliding Mode (GTSM) with fuzzy control. This control law aims to guarantee the avoidance of the kinematic disturbances which are injected in the angular and linear velocities, respectively. Moreover, the dynamic model based on exponential reaching law is presented to avoid the uncertainties. The control law provides the asymptotic stability by taking into account the fuzzy rules and Lyapunov theory. Thus, the chattering phenomenon should be avoided. The simulation works prove the robustness of the proposed control law by considering the disturbances function and the robot can follow the desired trajectories.",

The proposed method enables a timing response model of the circuit breaker to be developed using trip command parameters. In this paper, an experimental setup is used to perform trip response testing of a three-phase 75 kV circuit breaker.

		"Abstract": "Radar signals are time-varying signals where the signal parameters change over time. For these signals, Quadratic Time-Frequency Distribution (QTFD) offers advantages over classical spectrum estimation in terms of frequency and time resolution but it suffers heavily from cross-terms. In generating accurate Time-Frequency Representation (TFR), a kernel function must be able to suppress cross-terms while maintaining auto-terms energy especially in a non-cooperative environment where the parameters of the actual signal are unknown. Thus, a new signal-dependent QTFD is proposed that adaptively estimates the kernel parameters for a wide class of radar signals. The adaptive procedure, Doppler-Lag Block Searching (DLBS) kernel estimation was developed to serve this purpose. Accurate TFRs produced for all simulated radar signals with Instantaneous Frequency (IF) estimation performance are verified using Monte Carlo simulation meeting the requirements of the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) at SNR > 6 dB.",

		"Abstract": "Multilateration (MLAT) system estimates the position of an aircraft using Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) measurements estimated at spatially located Ground Receiving Station (GRS) pairs with a lateration algorithm. The Position Estimation (PE) accuracy of an MLAT system depends on several factors, one of which is the choice of reference station used to generate the TDOA estimations for use with the lateration algorithm. Furthermore, the closed-form lateration algorithm is known to introduce bias in the PE process. Thus, a bias analysis and improvement in the PE accuracy of an MLAT system with a reference selection technique is presented in the paper. The analysis is carried out for a square GRS configuration with each GRS equipped with a receiver whose Time of Reception (TOR) error Standard Deviation (SD) is assumed 1 nsec. Monte Carlo simulation result of lateration algorithm with reference selection technique shows a reduction of at least 75% in both the overall PE Mean Square Error (MSE) and bias. Furthermore, the PE Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) obtained by the lateration algorithm is reduced by at least 50% out of which 36% of the reduced PE RMSE is contributed only by the TOR estimation error.",

		"Abstract": "This paper deals with the use of a Nonuniform Linear Antenna array (NLA) for determining the Directions of Arrival (DOA) of a signal in 2450MHz frequency band. First, the principle of the DOA estimation method is described for the case of the MUSIC method. This paper also discusses the possibilities of optimizing the position of antenna elements in the NLA configuration, which are performed in analytical solutions and simulations. The simulation results are compared to the analytical results to obtain optimal NLA configurations for determining the signal DOA. Simulation results show that the probability of resolution and accuracy in determining the signal DOA are dependent on the antenna array aperture essentially. Furthermore, the realized NLA configuration was verified by an experimental measurement. The obtained experiment results demonstrate that the applied MUSIC method for NLA configuration is suitable and also highly accurate in determining the signal DOA, which was verified.",

		"Abstract": "A mathematical model of a methane concentration sensor has been developed and studied, which takes into account the use of materials with different optical properties in the channel, spectral and spatial adjustment of the sensor components, losses at modulation and signal processing, as well as scattering and absorption of the optical emission flux in the channel. Taking into account results of modelling and experimental studies of the prototype sensor, confirming the adequacy of the proposed model, types of optoelectronic sensor components, as well as its design parameters with allowable deviations in manufacturing, have been substantiated and selected. The emission losses in the optical channel have been minimized when the informative parameter is maximized, which is absorption of optical emission by the measured methane concentration, by providing the length of the sensor measuring channel not more than 30 mm and the use of light and photodiodes with covering of their sensitive elements with chalcogenide glass. It has been established that the main measurement error of methane concentration with the application of these recommendations is not more than 0.04 vol.% with the regulated value of 0.20 vol.% in the range from 0 to 5 vol.%.",

		"Abstract": "With advances in CMOS- technology and sub-micron process, leakage power dissipation has become a critical design metric. To incorporate more functions, designs are getting complex, thereby increases leakage power dissipation. Low power design objective requires early exploration and estimation. In this paper, we present the power estimation models for ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) based designs at the C-level of abstraction. The method includes analysis and extraction of the application specific information from the LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine) bit-code; which further applies to train the neural network. The trained model is applied in the estimation of the leakage power. Estimation of design power using our models is compared to the implemented measurement, which demonstrates its accuracy. In addition, the proposed methodology is significantly quicker and abolishes the need of synthesis based exploration.",

		"Abstract": "Potentiostatic electrodeposition conducted at various deposition voltages from lactate-stabilized copper sulfate electrolyte was used for preparation of Cu2O layers for Photoelectrochemical (PEC) production of hydrogen. A novel approach based on an application of light during the electrodeposition is utilized to suppress the potential drop in the Cu2O layer during the potentiostatic deposition. Structures prepared under dark and light on an Ag substrate are analyzed by X-Ray Diffraction analysis (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV). It was shown that the application of light increases the deposition rate due to the contribution of the photogenerated carriers. The deposition voltage affects the photoresponse of light deposited structures but causes only a negligible change in dark deposited structures. The light deposited samples exhibited a higher photoresponse for all deposition voltages. The presented study suggests the light potentiostatic electrodeposition as an attractive approach for the preparation of Cu2O structures for cheap and efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting applications.",

		"Abstract": "Recently, Fully-Depleted Silicon on Insulator (FD-SOI) MOSFETs have been accepted as a favourable technology beyond nanometer nodes, and the technique of Recessed-Source/Drain (Re-S/D) has made it more immune in regards of various performance factors. However, the proper selection of Buried-Oxide (BOX) thickness is one of the major challenges in the design of FD-SOI based MOS devices in order to suppress the drain electric penetrations across the BOX interface efficiently. In this work, the effect of BOX thickness on the performance of TMG Re-S/D FD-SOI MOSFET has been presented at 60 nm gate length. The perspective of BOX thickness variation has been analysed on the basis of its surface potential profile and the extraction of the threshold voltage by performing two-dimensional numerical simulations. Moreover, to verify the short channel immunity, the impact of gate length scaling has also been discussed. It is found that the device attains two step-up potential profile with suppressed short channel effects. The outcomes reveal that the Drain Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) values are lower among conventional SOI MOSFETs. The device has been designed and simulated by using 2D numerical ATLAS Silvaco TCAD simulator.",

		"Abstract": "The main purpose of this paper is to integrate fuzzy logic technique and backstepping synthesis to sliding mode control to develop a Fuzzy Backstepping-Sliding Mode Controller (FBSMC) to resolve the problem of altitude and attitude tracking control of unmanned quadrotor systems under large external disturbances. First, a backstepping-sliding mode control for quadrotor is introduced. Moreover, a fuzzy logic system is employed to adapt the unknown switching gains to eliminate the chattering phenomenon induced by switching control on the conventional Backstepping-Sliding Mode Controller (BSMC). The dynamical motion equations are obtained by Euler-Newton formalism. The stability of the system is guaranteed in the sense of the Lyapunov stability theorem. Simulation results are carried out using Matlab/Simulink environment to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller.",

		"Abstract": "A novel method to locate the zone of transient faults and to classify the fault type in Power Distribution Systems using wavelet transforms and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) has been developed. It draws on advanced techniques of signal processing based on wavelet transforms, using data sampled from the main feeder current to extract important characteristics and dynamic features of the fault signal. In this method, algorithms designed for fault detection and classification based on features extracted from wavelet transforms were implemented. One of four different algorithms based on ANFIS, according to the type of fault, was then used to locate the fault zone. Studies and simulations in an EMTP-RV environment for the 25kV power distribution system of Canada were carried out by considering ten types of faults with different fault inception, fault resistance and fault locations. The simulation results showed high accuracy in classifying the type of fault and determining the fault area, so that the maximum observed error was less than 2%.",

The frequency ratio depends on the thickness of substrate and gap length between the fed and parasitic patches. The impedance bandwidth at lower resonant frequency is 23.7% (theoretical), 3.9% (simulated) and 8.7% (measured) and at upper resonant frequency it is 23.5% (theoretical), 4% (simulated) and 9.2% (measured). Simulated gain of the patch antenna is 1.6dBi at lower resonant frequency and 4.2 dBi at upper resonant frequency. Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) remains below 1.2. The electric and magnetic field radiation patterns at both the resonating frequencies clearly depict that the co-polarization is higher than the cross polarization. Experimental return loss (|S_11|), VSWR, input impedance and group delay are in close agreement with theoretical and simulated (by High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) Software) results.",

		"Abstract": "To be able to use robots of the same type in a swarm (in this case differential-drive robots) from a centralized computer, you need to control them in the same way even if the robots come from different manu\\-facturers. These robots should have the same capabilities: i.e. the same type of sensors and the same type of control commands. Currently, if we need to add sensors on a robot, we should first find out what are the hardware capabilities and what are the tools provided by the manufacturer (some have microcontrollers, others have ARM processors). The protocol to communicate with the onboard card (often a serial protocol) is different for each robot and we have to take that in account in our software so that the robots can be interchangeable.  \r\nThis paper describes the design and the results of using a standard interface (bridge) on a robot which allows wireless communication with a centralized computer and local serial communication with a mobile robot. On this interface, we can connect every sensor we want (infrared, ultrasound, laser, Kinect etc.) and we can always use the same tools to control them.\r\nExtension of the protocol of the Kobuki base (TurtleBot2) is proposed to be able to use the same type of frame as the TurtleBot 2 uses and to continue to use ROS middleware as is, but with the possibility to use data from new sensors implemented on the bridge. This article will focus on the use of the TurtleBot 2, but the same bridge will be adapted  to other robots allowing their interchangeability in the future.",

		"Abstract": "Electric drainage is a power electronic device used to protect underground metal devices (such as piping) from the corrosive effects of stray currents. Stray currents are usually caused by DC electric traction, such as trams or railways. In places where stray currents leave the underground device and return into rails, they cause significant electrochemical corrosion of buried devices. The principle of electric drainage is based on electrical connection between the underground device and electric traction rails, which ensures that current flows through this connection, instead of flowing into the ground. Nowadays, the most widely used type is regulated electric drainage, where current is regulated by means of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Because of this modulation, current flowing through the drainage contains harmonic components with different frequencies. In modern railways, track circuits are often used as an important part of the track security system. For safe operation, it is necessary to ensure that frequencies generated by the drainage do not interfere with track circuits. This paper describes the design of a regulated drainage control system, with regard to its compatibility with track circuits and this paper contains related computer simulations and discussion of the results",

		"Abstract": "This paper deals with the change of the ratio of the open circuit impedance to short-circuit impedance of the electric traction depending on the distance of the traction vehicle from the beginning of the section. This ratio is calculated in order to estimate the traction vehicle speed and the distance at which the track occupancy can be indicated. Therefore, the impedance moduli and the impedance phases of the open track circuit and the impedance of the occupied track (short-circuit impedance) is compared at different short-circuit distances. The impedances ratio varies with changing weather conditions. It is different in dry weather than in the rain. Therefore, in practical use, the track occupancy indicator must always be updated and the ratio must always be recalculated for the new situation. In this paper, the impedances ratio is calculated for specific parameters measured in the section of the track in Orlova. The distance between a reference point (place of short circuit rails) from a measuring point is for the impedance module ratio of F = 10 about 218 m.",

		"Abstract": "Among other aspects, the reliability of electricity meters is important for securing energy supply and other Smart Grid (SG) functions and services. This paper analyses the reliability of functions and services provided by electricity meters in relation to reliability of individual electricity meters and their components. The increasing reliability requirements lead to higher complexity and manufacturing cost of electricity meter. On the other hand, purchase price pressure may cause increased failure rate of an individual meter, drop in overall reliability of SG environment, and finally can increase operating costs. Thus, Total Cost of smart meter Ownership (TCO) is associated with the failure rate (reliability). While seeking optimal TCO/reliability ratio, a contribution of each individual component to the overall failure rate of an electricity meter was investigated. Expected development of selected components reliability parameters and its influence on failure rate of meter and metering system was also estimated.",

		"Abstract": "Nowadays, Cu_2O is very promising electrode material for photoelectrochemical applications. In this paper, we report on the controllable synthesis of Cu_2O single particles as well as compact layers on Boron Doped Diamond (BDD) electrodes using potentiostatic deposition in continuous and pulse mode. The BDD layers were prepared with different B/C ratios in the gas phase in order to investigate boron doping level influence on the Cu_2O properties. The effect of electrodeposition conditions such as deposition regime and pulse duration was investigated as well. The Cu_2O covered BDD electrodes were analysed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy. Improvement in the homogeneity of the electrodeposit and removal of clusters were achieved when the pulse potentiostatic regime was used. Using the same pulse electrodeposition parameters, we confirmed the possibility of controlling the deposition rate of Cu_2O by varying the BDD conductivity. Finally, we were able to scale the size of Cu_2O particles by changing the number of deposition pulses. The obtained results have shown a great potential of controlling the morphology, amount, size and distribution of Cu_2O films on BDD substrates by changing the boron doping level and electrodeposition conditions as well. The investigations reported herein allowed us to better understand the deposition mechanism of Cu_2O on BDD electrodes which could then be used for preparation of active layers for electrochemical applications and in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and photodetectors.",

		"Abstract": "Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) process strongly depends on the type of the applied lithographic system, composed of electron sensitive polymers and the substrate. Moreover, applied acceleration voltage changes the volume of Backscattered Electrons (BSE) participation in total energy absorption in resist layers. Proper estimation of energy distribution in used materials, due to electron scattering, is the key in final resist profile calculation and critical parameter in the designing process of the lithography exposure. In the presented paper, the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of electron beam influence on lithographic system, consisting of positive tone resists (PMMA/MA and CSAR-62) spin coated on different substrates, will be presented. For high accuracy, obtained point spread functions were modelled by double-Gaussian function for Si, GaAs, AlGaN/GaN and InP substrates, respectively. Extracted scattering parameters of forward and backward electrons will be shown and their differences will be discussed. Results of simulated and conducted process of 100 nm metallic path fabrication on mentioned materials will be presented and compared. The practical usage of EBL technique will be shown in the aspect off low resolution application in low energy range of primary electron beam.",

The effect of sensors faults on the IM vector control is presented, then, new detection and isolation approaches are suggested. Speed sensor faults are detected when an error between only two points from speed data exceeds a certain threshold. An algorithm based on RMS currents is developed to detect and isolate any faulty current sensor. This requires three current sensors, each per phase. Besides, open circuit faults of inverter power switches are taken into account too. To ensure continuous functionality of the drive, we conceived an Active Fault Tolerant Controller (AFTC) with smoother reconfiguration feature.

		"Abstract": "The contribution of Distributed Generation (DG) systems like wind energy systems and solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems on the generation of electricity has increased. Out of these DG systems, the PV systems have gained wide popularity, because of the availability of solar energy throughout the day. Depending on the size of PV installations, a large number of PV modules can be interconnected in the form of series and parallel connection. Since a large number of modules are interconnected, it is possible for the faults in a PV array to occur due to the failure of protection system, which can cause damage to the PV module and also the decrease in the output power. This paper presents the tracking of a maximum power point under the faulty conditions of 12x5 PV array. The fault conditions that have been considered in the PV array are open circuit fault, line to ground, line to line and failure of bypass diodes. Perturb and observe, incremental conductance and fuzzy logic controller are the maximum power point tracking techniques that have been implemented. For each of the fault conditions, the results have been presented in terms of the maximum power tracked, tracking time and tracking efficiency.",

		"Abstract": "The proposed paper presents a simple and particularly efficacious Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm based on Silver Mean Method (SMM). This method operates by choosing a search interval from the P-V characteristics of the given solar array and converges to MPP of the Solar Photo-Voltaic (SPV) system by shrinking its interval. After achieving the maximum power, the algorithm stops shrinking and maintains constant voltage until the next interval is decided. The tracking capability efficiency and performance analysis of the proposed algorithm are validated  by the simulation and experimental results with a 100W solar panel for variable temperature and irradiance conditions. The results obtained confirm that even without any perturbation and observation process, the proposed method still outperforms the traditional perturb and observe (P&O) method by demonstrating far better steady state output, more accuracy and higher efficiency.",

		"Abstract": "The paper presents a vector control with two cascaded loops to improve the properties of Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) to minimize Voltage Sags on the grid. Thereby, a vector controlled structure was built on the rotating dq-coordinate system with the combination of voltage control and the current control. The proposed DVR control method is modelled using MATLAB-Simulink. It is tested using balanced/unbalanced voltage sags as well as fluctuant and distorted voltages. As a result, by using this controlling method, the dynamic characteristics of the system have been improved significantly. The system performed with higher accuracy, faster response and lower distortion in the voltage sags compensation. The paper presents real time experimental results to verify the performance of the proposed method in real environments.",

		"Abstract": "Because of increased number of sensitive loads and automated processes in industry, need for high quality power is nowadays inevitable. Deteriorated power quality my result in huge financial losses and also decreases the productivity. The power electronic based solutions for improving power quality have become more common in the recent years. One of these solutions is to use the Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR), which is a series-connected voltage compensator. Interline DVR (IDVR) is a special structure, in which two DVRs share a DC-link. These two DVRs are installed in two independent distribution feeders which may have two different voltage levels. In this paper, a new structure for IDVR is proposed. The proposed DVR is based on the multilevel converters. Therefore, we call it as Multilevel Converter based IDVR (MLC-IDVR). Because of using multilevel converter, the quality of voltage waveform in the proposed structure is improved in comparison with the conventional IDVR. Also, it is more suitable for higher voltage applications. The performance of the proposed MLC-IDVR is verified by simulation results carried out by PSCAD/EMTDC software.",

		"Abstract": "This paper examines the influence of Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) on the oscillation damping control in the network. The performance of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) controller highly depends upon its parameters and appropriate location in the network. A new Adaptive Inertia Weight Particle Swarm Optimization (AIWPSO) method is employed to design the parameters of the SSSC-base controller. In the proposed controller, the proper signal of the power system such as rotor angle is used as the feedback. AIWPSO technique has high flexibility and balanced mechanism for the local and global research. The proposed controller is compared with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based controller that confirms the operation of the controller. To show the integrity of the proposed controller method, the achievement of the simulations is done out in a single-machine infinite-bus and multi-machine grid under multi turmoil.",

		"Abstract": "Voltage harmonics, sag, and swell are the most harmful disturbances in distribution systems. This paper introduces a novel effective controller method for simultaneous compensation of both voltage sag/swell and voltage harmonics by using multifunctional dynamic voltage restorer. In proposed controller method called FFT with integrated ISRF, ISRF detects the magnitudes of voltage sag/swell quickly and precisely, and FFT extracts the selective components of voltage harmonics very effectively. The proposed method integrates the superior properties of ISRF and FFT methods. FFT integrated ISRF is applied for the first time to provide the compensation of both sag/swell and selective harmonics together. The proposed system has ability to compensate symmetrical/asymmetrical sag/swell and symmetrical/asymmetrical selective harmonics which are 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th. The controlled system is modelled in PSCAD/EMDTC and compared with conventional methods. The performance results verify that the proposed method compensates voltage disturbances effectively in the system.",

		"Abstract": "The control of power converter devices is one of the main research lines in interfaced renewable energy sources, such as solar cells and wind turbines. Therefore, suitable control algorithms should be designed in order to regulate power or current properly and attain a good power quality for some disturbances, such as voltage sag/swell, voltage unbalances and fluctuations, long interruptions, and harmonics. Various synchronisation techniques based control strategies are implemented for the hybrid power system applications under unbalanced conditions in literature studies. In this paper, synchronisation algorithms based Proportional-Resonant (PR) power/current controller is applied to the hybrid power system (solar cell + wind turbine + grid), and Dual Second Order Generalized Integrator-Phase Locked Loop (DSOGI-PLL) based PR controller in stationary reference frame provides a solution to overcome these problems. The influence of various cases, such as unbalance, and harmonic conditions, is examined, analysed and compared to the PR controllers based on DSOGI-PLL and SRF-PLL. The results verify the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed DSOGI-PLL based power control method.",

		"Abstract": "The flow of harmonic current encountered in nowadays electrical installations causes numerous undesirable issues to the power grid. The most detrimental consequence is the premature aging or even failure of the in-service power distribution transformers from industrial facilities (originally designed to cope with the linear loads). Accordingly, the paper quantitatively examines the major thermal operating parameters of these transformers and predicts their lifetime expectancy under a certain harmonic load spectrum. The developed computation principle is based on the international standard recommendations and only demands the load current harmonic content (measured with a power quality analyzer) and the transformer rated data. The study is also carried out on a 250 kVA oil-type three-phase power distribution transformer from a pumping station.",

		"Abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of studies on biological effects of Electromagnetic (EM) fields emitted from Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs). The biological effects of generated and real telecommunication signals produced by different types of exposure systems are discussed. However, the proper exposure methods for such experiments are very limited. We successfully developed a simple and cost-effective exposure unit with real GSM/DCS/UMTS signal from BTS containing proper modulations or intermittence (continuous, interrupted). Signal processing and conditioning unit is based on a Radiofrequency (RF) repeater. The downlink signal is filtered by integrated high selectivity passband filters and amplified to a required level. The main part of exposure unit is a Faraday cage with the specimen (exposure) area measuring 150 x 250 mm with E-field percent deviation less than 18%. This exposure system can be helpful in experiments with living organisms in in vivo studies and in vitro studies with normal or pathological cells and other micro scale structures being exposed to RF EM fields from BTS.",

		"Abstract": "This paper describes different approaches for the face authentication from the features and classification abilities point of view. Authors compare two types of features - Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) including their combination. These parameters are classified using Multilayer Neural Network (MLNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Face authentication consists of several steps. The first step contains Viola-Jones algorithm for face detection. Authors resize the detected face for a fixed vector and afterwards, it is converted into grayscale. Next, feature extraction with a simple Min-Max normalization is applied. Obtained parameters are evaluated by classifiers and for each detected face, authors get posterior probability as the output of the classifier. Different approaches for face authentication are compared with each other using False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR), Equal Error Rate (EER), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) curves. The results are verified with AR Face Database and elaborated in a feature extraction and classifier design point of view. Best results were achieved by HOG feature for SVM classifier. Detailed results are listed in the text below.",

		"Abstract": "The vulnerability of digital images is growing towards manipulation. This motivated an area of research to deal with digital image forgeries. The certifying origin and content of digital images is an open problem in the multimedia world. One of the ways to find the truth of images is finding the presence of any type of contrast enhancement. In this work, novel and simple machine learning tool is proposed to detect the presence of histogram equalization using statistical parameters of DC Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. The statistical parameters of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitted to DC DCT coefficients are used as features for classifying original and histogram equalized images. An SVM classifier has been developed to classify original and histogram equalized image which can detect histogram equalized image with accuracy greater than 95% when false rate is less than 5%.",

		"Abstract": "This paper applies a relatively new optimization method, the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm for Optimal Power Flow (OPF) of two-terminal High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) electrical power system. The OPF problem of pure AC power systems considers the minimization of total costs under equality and inequality constraints. Hence, the OPF problem of integrated AC-DC power systems is extended to incorporate HVDC links, while taking into consideration the power transfer control characteristics using a GWO algorithm. This algorithm is inspired by the hunting behavior and social leadership of grey wolves in nature. The proposed algorithm is applied to two different case-studies: the modified 5-bus and WSCC 9-bus test systems. The validity of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by comparing the obtained results with those reported in literature using other optimization techniques. Analysis of the obtained results show that the proposed GWO algorithm is able to achieve shorter CPU time, as well as minimized total cost when compared with already existing optimization techniques. This conclusion proves the efficiency of the GWO algorithm.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents the Congestion Management (CM) methodologies and how they get modified in the new competitive framework of electricity power markets. When the load on the system is increased or when some contingency occurs in the system, some of the lines may become overloaded. Thus, the loadability of the system should be increased by generating and dispatching the power optimally for the secure operation of power system. In this paper, the CM problem is solved by using the optimal rescheduling of generating units and load demands, and the Swarm intelligent techniques are used to handle this problem. Here, the CM problem is solved by using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Fitness Distance Ratio PSO (FDR-PSO) and Fuzzy Adaptive-PSO (FA-PSO). First, the generating units are selected based on sensitivity to the over-loaded transmission line, and then these generators are rescheduled to remove the congestion in the transmission line. This paper also utilizes the demand response offers to solve the CM problem. The effectiveness of the proposed CM methodology is examined on the IEEE 30 bus and Indian 75 bus test systems.",

		"Abstract": "This paper proposes an approach based on the Symbiotic Organism Search (SOS) for optimal determining sizing, siting, and number of Distributed Generations (DG) in distribution systems. The objective of the problem is to minimize the power loss of the system subject to the equality and inequality constraints such as power balance, bus voltage limits, DG capacity limits, and DG penetration limit. The SOS approach is defined as the symbiotic relationship observed between two organisms in an ecosystem, which does not need the control parameters like other meta-heuristic algorithms in the literature. For the implementation of the proposed method to the problem, an integrated approach of Loss Sensitivity Factor (LSF) is used to determine the optimal location for installation of DG units, and SOS is used to find the optimal size of DG units. The proposed method has been tested on IEEE 33-bus, 69-bus, and 118-bus radial distribution systems. The obtained results from the SOS algorithm have been compared to those of other methods in the literature. The simulated results have demonstrated that the proposed SOS method has a very good performance and effectiveness for the problem of optimal placement of DG units in distribution systems.",

		"Abstract": "In the few last decades, Distribution Generation (DG) has drawn a great attention by researchers around the world in the field of Radial Distributed Systems (RDSs). Generally, the optimal placement is based on the maximization of the Voltage Stability Index (VSI) and the optimal sizing is based on the minimization of the Total Active Power Losses (TAPLs). Hence, a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOOP) is proposed to achieve the both mentioned objectives. For this purpose, a new simple optimization algorithm known as Bat Algorithm (BA) based on Weight Sum Method (WSM) has been used to resolve the MOOP. Then, the Fuzzy Based (FB) technique is employed to find the Best Compromise Solution.  This paper also provides a comparison between the proposed algorithm and other recently published methods. From the obtained results, the advantage of the proposed algorithm is clearly observed from multiple points of view such as enhancement of Voltage Profile (VP), decreasing of the TAPL, and the maximization of the VSI. The investigations have been carried out on a standard IEEE 12-bus, 33-bus, 69-bus, and 85-bus test feeders.",

		"Abstract": "Induction motors are widely used in an industry and it is necessary to improve control methods for induction motors to increase the efficiency of them. In this paper, sliding mode controllers are proposed instead of traditional PI controllers in vector control of induction motor drives. Moreover, rotor speed is estimated by a sliding mode observer. In addition, the robustness of control and observer algorithms are also proved by Lyapunov\u2019s criterion. The experiments are obtained in different speed changes of an induction motor drive.

		"Abstract": "The article describes simulations of the occurrence of stray currents in the vicinity of a SUDOP-type railway platform. Stray currents occur in the vicinity of a railway platform during the passage of a railway vehicle. In a fault-free state, all metallic parts are separated from the rail by means of a surge arrester. In the case of a breakdown of the surge arrester, the full voltage which is on the rail at the time of the passing railway vehicle may also pass onto the metallic parts. The surge arresters are checked every 6 months during maintenance work on the overhead lines according to Annex No. 1 of SZDC internal regulation E 500.\r\nThe article, therefore, carries out a simulation of stray currents in exactly this type of breakdown. In addition, to the model, we included the influence of the outdoor lighting cable which is located in the ground under the platform. For the purposes of solving the model, we are using a commercially available program which solves partial differential equations and uses the finite element method for calculation.",

		"Abstract": "Due to conventional differential evolution algorithm is often trapped in local optima and premature convergence in high dimensional optimization problems, a State Evaluation Adaptive Differential Evolution algorithm (SEADE) is proposed in this paper. By using independent scale factor on each dimension of optimization problem, and evaluating the distribution of population on each dimension, the SEADE correct the control parameters adaptively. External archive and a moving window evaluation mechanism on evolution state are introduced in SEADE to detect whether the evolution is stagnation or not, and with the help of opposition-based population, the algorithm can jump out of local optima basins. The results of experiments on several benchmarks show that the proposed algorithm is capable of improving the search performance of high dimensional optimization problems. And it is more efficient in design FIR digital filter using SEADE than conventional method like Parks-McClellan algorithm.",

		"Abstract": "A novel topology of four-quadrant analog multiplier circuit is presented in this paper. The voltage mode technique is employed to design the circuit in CMOS technology. The dynamic input and output ranges of the circuit are improved owing to the fact that the circuit works in the saturation region not in weak inversion. Also the proposed multiplier is suitable for low voltage operation and its power consumption is relatively low. In order to verify the performance of the proposed circuit, performance of the circuit affected by second order effects including transistor mismatch and mobility reduction is analyzed in detail. It will be shown that any conceivable mismatch in the transistor parameters leads to second harmonic distortion. Additionally, the effect of mobility reduction in the third harmonic distortion will be computed. In order to simulate the circuit, Cadence and HSPICE software are used with TSMC level 49 (BSIM3v3) parameters for 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology, where under supply voltage of 1.5 V, total power consumption is 44 \u00b5W, the corresponding average nonlinearity remains as low as 1 %, and the input range of the circuit is \u00b1 400 mV.",

The hysteresis of the proposed circuit is generated using cross-coupled pMOS or nMOS transistors, which can be tuned by engineering cross-coupled transistors current. By changing input voltage, the hysteresis window can also be adequately adjusted. Negative feedback has been introduced through CMOS differential amplifier which makes the circuit less sensitive to process, supply voltage and temperature (PVT) deviations.

The current mode biquadratic filter offers all the five basic responses along with independent tunability of its quality factor. The dual-mode quadrature sinusoidal oscillator offers explicit current outputs along with voltage outputs. The circuit also offers a simple and uncoupled condition of oscillation and frequency of oscillation.

		"Abstract": "A new OTRA-based multifunction Inverse filter configuration is presented which is capable of realizing low pass, high pass and band pass filters using only two OTRAs and five to six passive elements. To the best knowledge of the authors, any inverse filter configuration using OTRAs has not been reported in the literature earlier. The effect of the major parasitics of the OTRAs and their effect on the performance filter have been investigated and measured through simulation results and Monte-Carlo analysis. The workability of the proposed circuits has been confirmed by SPICE simulations using CMOS-based-OTRA realizable in 0.18 \u00b5m CMOS technology. The proposed circuits are the only ones which provide simultaneously the following features: use of reasonable number of active elements (only 2), realizability of all the three basic filter functions, employment of all virtually grounded resistors and capacitors and tunability of all filter parameters (except gain factor, H_0 for inverse high pass).\r\nThe centre/cut-off frequency of the various filter circuits lying in the vicinity of 1 MHz have been found to be realizable, which has been verified through SPICE simulation results and have been found to be in good agreement with the theoretical results.",

		"Abstract": "The occurrence of speckle noise in medical Ultrasound (US) images poses a big challenge to medical practitioners over last several years. Speckle noise reduces the fine details present in the images and hence make it more difficult to diagnose. In this paper, a~novel method based on the combination of three spatial domain filters is presented. The output of these filters is combined on the basis of an Intensity Classifier Map (ICF) formed using Coefficient of Dispersion (CoD) parameter. Experiments were conducted on synthetic and real US images. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the proposed method is carried out in comparison to other six existing methods. It has been found from the obtained results that proposed method delivers observable improvement in all quantitative parameters undertaken for synthetic US image and in MVR value for real US images. Also, the effectiveness of the proposed method is found to be consistent with qualitative assessment of the denoised images.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, we investigate optical network recommendations GPON and XG-PON with triple-play services in terms of physical reach, number of subscribers, transceiver design, modulation format and implementation cost. Despite of trends to increase the bit rate from 2.5 Gbps to 10 Gbps and beyond, TDM-PONs cannot cope with bandwidth requirements of future networks. TDM and WDM techniques can be combined, resulting in improved scalability. Longer physical reach can be achieved by deploying active network elements within the transmission path. We investigate these options by considering their potential coexistence at the physical layer. Subsequently, we analyse the upgrade of optical channels to 100 Gbps and 256 Gbps by using advanced modulation formats, which combine polarization division multiplexing with coherent detection and digital signal processing. We show that PDM-QPSK format is suitable for 100 Gbps systems and PDM-16QAM is more beneficial at 256 Gbps. Simulations are performed in the OptSim software environment.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, we present and analyze the influence of (La,Ce,Tb)PO_4:Ce:Tb green phosphor (LaTb) toward the performance of the multi-chip white LED (MCW-LEDs) lamps including color uniformity, lumen output, Color Rendering Index (CRI), and Color Quality Scale (CQS). By mixing the LaTb green phosphor and the YAG:Ce yellow phosphor compounding under condition of 7000 K MCW-LEDs, this new approach can produce a huge meaningful change in lumen output and the angular color distribution of MCW-LEDs. We also study the interaction between the concentration and size of the LaTb particles with output flux, color uniformity, CRI, and CQS. The obtained results demonstrate that the higher lumen output, the higher color uniformity enhancement could be attained by adding the LaTb particles with a size range around 6-8 \u00b5m and the concentration around 1.5% in phosphor layer. Meanwhile, the decrease of the color rendering value (CRI) and the Color Quality Scale (CQS) tend to be stable and insignificant. In other words, the obtained results provide a prospective method which plays an important role in the development of MCW-LED manufacturing technology.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, we propose an energy-harvesting cooperation scheme in which relays suffer in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalances (IQI) and harvest energy from a wireless transmit source.  A best relay is selected based on end-to-end signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) in both Amplify-and-Forward (called an EHAF protocol) and Decode-and-Forward (called an EHDF protocol) cooperation methods. We analyze and evaluate the system performance in terms of exact closed-form throughputs over Rayleigh fading channels. Simulation and analysis results discover contributions as follows. Firstly, the throughput performance of the proposed protocols EHAF and EHDF is improved when comparing with that of a non-selection cooperation scheme. Secondly, the EHDF protocol is more efficient than the EHAF protocol. Finally, the theoretical analyses are validated by performing Monte Carlo simulations.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, we evaluate system performances of a multi-hop relay protocol with presence of an active eavesdropper. In the proposed protocol, a source attempts to transmit its data to a destination with assistance of multiple intermediate relays. From the eavesdropping Channel State Information (CSI) estimated, the source and relays adjust their transmit power so that the eavesdropper cannot overhear the transmitted data. Moreover, to enhance throughput for the proposed system, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technique with a simple power allocation is also proposed. We derive exact closed-form expressions of the Outage Probability (OP) and throughput for the data transmission over Rayleigh fading channel. In addition, when the CSI estimation is imperfect, Intercept Probability (IP) at the eavesdropper is derived. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are presented to verify the theoretical derivations.",

		"Abstract": "In this work, the method and prototype for managing the quality of wireless communication channel is presented. The proposed methodology, based on multi-criteria information utility assessment process, is designed. The heterogeneous context awareness data collection subsystems integration is enabled by transforming the acquired data to the highly dynamic intelligent transport systems. Each element of this intellectual transport system runs as a separate component having a specific environmental monitoring and control elements. Evaluation of context information utility allowed realizing the methods and algorithms that adaptively reduce the load on the wireless channel, and the transmitted and stored data volume without losing the enriched contextual information quality, which allows developing more complex heterogeneous services. It is believed that the obtained scientific results will have positive effect for the future research and development of context awareness and service adaptation systems.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, are described the basics of Social Based Mobility Model inspired by mobility of students alongside with Metrics for Evaluation of Social Behaviour in Mobility Models for MANET-DTN networks. These networks are mobile networks, where mobile devices are carried by humans. For simulation purposes, it is useful if mobility models designed to evaluate and tests performance of routing protocols are using mobility patterns and behaviour of humans. For these reasons, Students Social Based Mobility Model (SSBMM) was proposed as simulation tool with social mobility of nodes. To prove that SSBMM is really using social behaviour of nodes, Metrics for Evaluation of Social Behaviour in Mobility Models was designed. These metrics were adapted to the mobility of nodes in order to be able to reveal if the mobility of nodes in used mobility models is social. The performed simulations prove deviation of SSBMM from random mobility models. Described metrics reveal that SSBMM has strong social ties among nodes in comparison with random mobility models.",

		"Abstract": "In hyperspectral classification, a derivative of reflectance spectra is used directly or by fusion with the reflectance spectra. In this way, classification performance is improved. However, on the land cover, especially for plant species, the reflectance spectra may exhibit differences depending on a plant age and maturity level. This situation makes traditional classification methods which are based on time-dependent spectral similarity. In addition, the problem of classification of the species which have similar spectral properties is still valid. As a solution to time dependency and spectral similarity problems, in this study, a new and more generic method based on the spectral derivative is proposed. The method is tested for hyperspectral images which are captured at different time of the year and different places, in the life cycle of species. Test results show that proposed method successfully classifies the land cover time-independent and it is superior to the classical classification methods.",

In our experiments, the overall recognition accuracy of the PCA, LBPH, KNN and proposed CNN is demonstrated. All the experiments were implemented on the ORL database and the obtained experimental results were shown and evaluated. This face database consists of 400 different subjects (40 classes/ 10 images for each class). The experimental result shows that the LBPH provide better results than PCA and KNN. These experimental results on the ORL database demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method for face recognition. For proposed CNN we have obtained a best recognition accuracy of 98.3 %.

		"Abstract": "This paper deals with the influence of bit depth on the subjective video quality assessment. To achieve this goal, eight video sequences, each representing a different content prototype, were analysed. Subjective evaluation was performed using the ACR method. The analysed video sequences were encoded to 8 and 10-bit bit depth. Two most used compression standards H.264 and H.265 were evaluated with 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 Mbps bitrate in Full HD and UHD resolution. Finally, the perceived quality of both compression standards using the subjective tests with emphasis on bit-depth was compared. From the results we can state, that the practical application of 10-bit bit depth is not appropriate for Full HD resolution in the range of bitrate from 1 to 15 Mbps, for Ultra HD resolution, it is appropriate only for videos encoded by H.265/HEVC compression standard.",

		"Abstract": "Condition monitoring and fault detection of induction machines become an important area of research. Many techniques have been applied in this field including vibration, thermal, chemical and acoustic emission monitoring, but Motor Current Signature Analysis monitoring techniques usually are applied to detect the various classes of induction machine faults such as rotor, short winding, eccentricity and bearing fault etc. This paper presents a wireless system detection for rotor eccentricity faults in induction machine based on LabVIEW platform. Moreover, it is demonstrated that eccentricity fault generates a series of low frequency components in the form of sidebands around the fundamental frequency and its harmonic. In addition, the amplitudes of those components increase in proportion to the load and fault severity. The Power Spectral Density techniques and Short Time Frequency Transform spectrogram of current signals are used to detect the presence of those fault signatures",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, a two-level sensorless Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) strategy is presented for a variable speed Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS). The proposed system is composed of a wind turbine, a direct-drive Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) and a three phase controlled rectifier connected to a DC load. The realised generator output power maximization analysis justifies the use of the Field Oriented Control (FOC) giving the six Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals to the active rectifier. The generator rotor speed and position required by the FOC and the sensorless MPPT are estimated using a Synchronous Reference Frame Phase Locked Loop (SRF-PLL). The MPPT strategy used consists of two levels, the first level is a power regulation loop and the second level is an extremum seeking bloc generating the coefficient gathering the turbine characteristics. Experimental results validated on a hardware test setup using a DSP digital board (dSPACE 1104) are presented. Figures illustrating the estimated speed and angle confirm that the SRF-PLL is able to give an estimated speed and angle which closely follow the real ones. Also, the power at the DC load and the power at the generator output indicate that the MPPT gives optimum extracted power. Finally, other results show the effectiveness of the adopted approach in real time applications.",

		"Abstract": "Multilateration estimates aircraft position using the Time Difference Of Arrival (TDOA) with a lateration algorithm. The Position Estimation (PE) accuracy of the lateration algorithm depends on several factors which are the TDOA estimation error, the lateration algorithm approach, the number of deployed GRSs and the selection of the GRS reference used for the PE process. Using the minimum number of GRSs for 3D emitter PE, a technique based on the condition number calculation is proposed to select the suitable GRS reference pair for improving the accuracy of the PE using the lateration algorithm. Validation of the proposed technique was performed with the GRSs in the square and triangular GRS configuration. For the selected emitter positions, the result shows that the proposed technique can be used to select the suitable GRS reference pair for the PE process. A unity condition number is achieved for GRS pair most suitable for the PE process. Monte Carlo simulation result, in comparison with the fixed GRS reference pair lateration algorithm, shows a reduction in PE error of at least 70 % for both GRS in the square and triangular configuration.",

		"Abstract": "The use of single time-instance features, where entire speech utterance is used for feature computation, is not accurate and adequate in capturing the time localized information of short-time transient distortions and their distinction from plosive sounds of speech, particularly degraded by impulsive noise. Hence, the importance of estimating features at multiple time-instances is sought. In this, only active speech segments of degraded speech are used for features computation at multiple time-instances on per frame basis. Here, active speech means both voiced and unvoiced frames except silence. The features of different combinations of multiple contiguous active speech segments are computed and called multiple time-instances features. The joint GMM training has been done using these features along with the subjective MOS of the corresponding speech utterance to obtain the parameters of GMM. These parameters of GMM and multiple timeinstances features of test speech are used to compute the objective MOS values of different combinations of multiple contiguous active speech segments. The overall objective MOS of the test speech utterance is obtained by assigning equal weight to the objective MOS values of the different combinations of multiple contiguous active speech segments. This algorithm outperforms the Recommendation ITU-T P.563 and recently published algorithms.",

		"Abstract": "Studying muscle fatigue plays an important role in preventing the risks associated with musculoskeletal disorders. The effect of elbow-joint angle on time-frequency parameters during a repetitive motion provides valuable information in finding the most accurate position of the angle causing muscle fatigue. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of muscle fatigue on the spectral and time-frequency domain parameters derived from electromyography (EMG) signals using the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). Four male participants were recruited to perform a repetitive motion (flexion and extension movements) from a non-fatigue to fatigue condition. EMG signals were recorded from the biceps muscle. The recorded EMG signals were then analyzed offline using the complex Morlet wavelet. The time-frequency domain data were analyzed using the time-averaged wavelet spectrum (TAWS) and the Scale-Average Wavelet Power (SAWP) parameters. The spectral domain data were analyzed using the Instantaneous Mean Frequency (IMNF) and the Instantaneous Mean Power Spectrum (IMNP) parameters. The index of muscle fatigue was observed by calculating the increase of the IMNP and the decrease of the IMNF parameters. After performing a repetitive motion from non-fatigue to fatigue condition, the average of the IMNF value decreased by 15.69 % and the average of the IMNP values increased by 84 %, respectively. This study suggests that the reliable frequency band to detect muscle fatigue is 31.10\u201336.19 Hz with linear regression parameters of 0.979 mV2 \u00b7Hz\u22121 and 0.0095 mV2 \u00b7Hz\u22121 for R2 and slope, respectively.",

		"Abstract": "It is well established that sleep spindles (bursts of oscillatory brain electrical activity) are significant indicators of learning, memory and some disease states. Therefore, many attempts have been made to detect these hallmark patterns automatically. In this pilot investigation, we paid special attention to nonlinear chaotic features of EEG signals (in combination with linear features) to investigate the detection and prediction of sleep spindles. These nonlinear features included: Higuchi\u2019s, Katz\u2019s and Sevcik\u2019s Fractal Dimensions, as well as the Largest Lyapunov Exponent and Kolmogorov\u2019s Entropy. It was shown that the intensity map of various nonlinear features derived from the constructive interference of spindle signals could improve the detection of the sleep spindles. It was also observed that the prediction of sleep spindles could be facilitated by means of the analysis of these maps. Two well-known classifiers, namely the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were used to distinguish between spindle and non-spindle patterns. The MLP classifier produced a high discriminative capacity (accuracy = 94.93 %, sensitivity = 94.31 % and specificity = 95.28 %) with significant robustness (accuracy ranging from 91.33 % to 94.93 %, sensitivity varying from 91.20 % to 94.31 %, and specificity extending from 89.79 % to 95.28 %) in separating spindles from non-spindles. This classifier also generated the best results in predicting sleep spindles based on chaotic features. In addition, the MLP was used to find out the best time window for predicting the sleep spindles, with the experimental results reaching 97.96 % accuracy.",

As EMG signals can be used to represent motion, we developed a non-pattern recognition method to estimate the elbow joint angle based on twelve timedomain features extracted from EMG signals recorded from bicep muscles alone. The extracted features were smoothed using a second order Butterworth low pass filter to produce the estimation. The accuracy of the estimated angles was evaluated by using the Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).The regression parameters (Euclidean distance, R2 and slope) were then calculated to observe the effect of the features on elbow joint angle estimation. In this investigation, we found that for a 10- second long recording period, the MyoPulse Percentage (MYOP) Rate produced the best accuracy: with PCC of 0.97 \u00b1 0.02 (Mean\u00b1SD) and RMSE of 11.37 \u00b1 3.04\u25e6 (Mean\u00b1SD), respectively. The MYOP feature also showed the highest R2 and slope value of 0.986\u00b10.0083 (Mean\u2019s) and 0.746 \u00b1 0.17 (Mean\u2019s), respectively for flexion and extension motions during all recorded periods.",

		"Abstract": "Highly accurate classification of sleep stages is possible based on EEG signals alone. However, reliable and high quality acquisition of these signals in the home environment is difficult. Instead, electrocardiogram (ECG) and Respiratory (Res) signals are easier to record and may offer a practical alternative for home monitoring of sleep. Therefore, automatic sleep staging was performed using ECG, Res (thoracic excursion) and EEG signals from 31 nocturnal recordings of the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) polysomnography Database. Feature vectors were extracted from 0.5 min (standard) epochs of sleep data by time-domain, frequency domain, time-frequency and nonlinear methods and optimized by using the Support Vector Machine -Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) method. These features were then classified by using a SVM. Classification based upon EEG features produced a Correct Classification Ratio CCR = 0.92. In comparison, features derived from ECG signals alone, that is the combination of Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and ECG-Derived Respiration (EDR) signals produced a CCR = 0.54, while those features based on the combination of HRV and (thoracic) Res signals resulted in a CCR = 0.57. Overall comparison of the results based on standard epochs of EEG signals with those obtained from 5-minute (long) epochs of cardiorespiratory signals, revealed that acceptable CCR = 0.81 and discriminative capacity (Accuracy = 89.32 %, Specificity = 92.88 % and Sensitivity = 78.64 %) were also achievable when using optimal feature sets derived from long epochs of the latter signals in sleep staging. In addition, it was observed that the presence of some artifacts (like bigeminy) in the cardiorespiratory signals reduced the accuracy of automatic sleep staging more than the artifacts that contaminated the EEG signals.",

		"Abstract": "Abdominal fetal ElectroCardioGrams (fECGs) carry a wealth of information about the fetus including fetal Heart Rate (fHR) and signal morphology during different stages of pregnancy. Here we report our results on the implementation and evaluation of two non-adaptive signal processing methods suitable for fECG signal extraction, namely: the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Methods. We used the fetal heart rate extracted from fECG signals (in Beats Per Minute - BPM) and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) as effective performance evaluation metrics for our applied methods. Our findings demonstrated that given adequate SNR, these methods produced excellent results in accurate determination of fHR. Furthermore, we found out that compared to the PCA Method, the ICA Method produces a lower variance in the detection of the fHR.",

		"Abstract": "The main aims of this paper are to study the influence of the Gestation Age (GA) on the quality of recorded abdominal ECG (aECG) signals and to evaluate the performance of the LMS and RLS adaptive signal processing algorithms in the extraction of the fetal ECG (fECG) signal component from such signals. This influence is quantified as a function of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Our research shows that these adaptive algorithms with optimized settings can successfully be applied to extract fECG signals from the maternal aECG signals as early as the 30th week of GA, hence addressing a limitation (37 weeks or labor) in commercially available monitoring systems. We demonstrate that before this gestational age, the SNR of the maternal aECG signal is too low for these adaptive algorithms to work effectively and produce satisfactory results.",

		"Abstract": "Currently, telecom operators use virtualization of network infrastructure based on Data Centers (DCs). But when a company grows to a certain size and one DC is not sufficient, there are questions how to further develop the network infrastructure. There is a need to expand existing DC boundaries or to add new elements in the network structure. In this paper, we propose improved adaptive routing algorithm in distributed networks of DCs with united service providers, which increases the efficiency of adaptive routing process during dynamic adding of nodes or communication links. The mathematical model and enlarged form of algorithm are shown in the work. In the paper, a comparison of the proposed algorithm with known analogies, such as modified Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm and paired transitions algorithm, is performed. To validate the correctness of proposed algorithm, we developed software for simulation of adaptive routing processes in networks of distributed DCs. Comparative analysis of adaptive routing algorithms in distributed networks of DCs with united service providers confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach and reduces the complexity of constructing routing tables to the value O(mN).",

In the process of image editing, contrast enhancement is a very common technique to hide visual traces of tampering. In our work, we have employed statistical distribution of block variance and AC DCT coefficients of an image to detect global contrast enhancement in an image. The variation in statistical parameters of block variance and AC DCT coefficients distribution for different degrees of contrast enhancement are used as features to detect contrast enhancement. An SVM classifier with 10 \u2212 fold cross-validation is employed. An overall accuracy greater than 99 % in detection with false rate less than 2 % has been achieved.

		"Abstract": "In this article we report on the validation of a novel fiber-optic sensor system suitable for simultaneous cardiac and respiration activity monitoring during Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examinations. This MRI-compatible Heart Rate (HR) and Respiration Rate (RR) measurement system is based on the Fiberoptic Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. Using our system, we performed real measurements on 4 test subjects (2 males and 2 females) after obtaining their written informed consents. The sensor was encapsulated inside a Polydimethylsiloxane polymer (PDMS), as this material does not react with the human skin and is unresponsive to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). The advantage of our design is that the sensor could be embedded inside a pad which is placed underneath a patient\u2019s body while lying in the supine position. The main feature of our system design is to maximize patient\u2018s safety and comfort while assisting the clinical staff in predicting and detecting impending patient\u2019s hyperventilation and panic attacks. To further validate the efficacy of our system, we used the Bland-Altman statistical analysis test on data acquired from all test subjects to determine the accuracy of cardiac and respiratory rate measurements. Our satisfactory results provide promising means to leverage the advancement of research in the field of noninvasive vital sign monitoring in MRI environments. In addition, our method and system enable the clinical staff to predict and detect patient\u2019s hyperventilation and panic attacks while undergoing an MRI examination.",

The sensor uses two interferometric probes encapsulated inside a PolyDiMethylSiloxane (PDMS) polymer. Based on real data acquired from pregnant women in a suitable research laboratory environment, once they had given their written informed consents, we created a simplified dynamic signal model of the distribution of maternal and fetal heart sounds inside the maternal body. Building upon this signal model, we verified the functionality of our novel fiber-optic sensor and its associated adaptive filtering system using the NLMS Algorithm. The main reason why we chose this technology to develop our system was that it allows monitoring the fHR without exposing the fetus to any external energies or radiation (in contrast to the ultrasound-based Cardiotocography Method). We used objective criteria such as: Signal to Noise Ratios: SNRin, SNRout and Percentage Root-mean-square Difference (PRD) for our evaluations.",

		"Abstract": "We demonstrate that diaphragms for sensor applications can be fabricated by laser ablation in a variety of substrates such as ceramics, glass, sapphire or SiC. However, ablation can cause pinholes in membranes made of SiC, Si and metals. Our experiments indicate that pinhole defects in the ablated membranes are affected by ripple structures related to the polarization of the laser. From our simulation results on light propagation in Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS) we find out that they are acting as a slot waveguide in SiC material. The results further show that field intensity is enhanced inside LIPSS and spreads out at surface distortions promoting the formation of pinholes. The membrane corner area is most vulnerable for pinhole formation. Pinholes funnel laser radiation into the bulk material causing structural damage and stress in the membrane. We show that a polarization flipping technique inhibits the formation of pin holes caused by LIPSS.",

		"Abstract": "The AC Alternating Current Induction Motor (IM) is the most commonly used AC motor in industrial applications because of its simplicity, robust construction, and relatively low manufacturing costs. To avoid expensive repairs in IM, early faults detection is needed. In this context, this paper presents a novel approach used to detect rotor asymmetries in induction motors. The Zero Sequence Voltage (ZSV) defined as the potential difference between the null point of the supply voltage system and the neutral of the star connection of IM stator winding is measured and employed for tracking the amplitude of the most sensitive harmonics in the spectrum of ZSV. This detection leads to make a criterion to take a decision about the state of the machine without a Prior knowledge. Simulation and experimental results obtained from real tests are presented to validate the study.",

		"Abstract": "A new four quadrant Field OrientationControlled (FOC) three-phase induction motor drive based on Hysteresis Current Comparison (HCC) has been developed. The direct relationship between current and torque in the Direct-Quadrature (dq) reference frames has been exploited to develop an HCC scheme that offers accurate tracking of current and torque based on the pulse width modulation technique. The parameters of the inner HCC and the outer ProportionalIntegral (PI) speed controllers have been optimised to obtain effective current and torque tracking. The complete closed loop system being speed-controlled, four quadrant operation has been obtained using step speed input while the suitability of the developed model has been tested under full load stress during steady state. The results obtained satisfy the four quadrant operation requirements of advanced drives where controlled starts and stops are essential in both forward and reverse directions. This is evident in the effectiveness of current and torque tracking and ease of speed transition from motoring to regeneration and vice versa. The developed model finds applications in advanced industrial drives as an energy-efficient and cost-effective alternative to eliminate the effects of supply voltage drops and mechanical load variations.",

		"Abstract": "This paper proposes the utilization of a DCDC boost converter as a mediator between a Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) array and the Voltage Source Inverters (VSI) in an SPV array powered air cooling system to attain maximum efficiency. The boost converter, over the various common DC-DC converters, offers many advantages in SPV based applications. Further, two Brushless DC (BLDC) motors are employed in the proposed air cooling system: one to run the centrifugal water pump and the other to run a fan-blower. Employing a BLDC motor is found to be the best option because of its top efficiency, supreme reliability and better performance over a wide range of speeds. The air cooling system is developed and simulated using the MATLAB/Simulink environment considering the steady state variation in the solar irradiance. Further, the efficiency of BLDC drive system is compared with a conventional Permanent Magnet DC (PMDC) motor drive system and from the simulated results it is found that the proposed system performs better.",

		"Abstract": "We propose a new method for maximizing the spread of influence, based on the identification of significant factors of the total energy of a control system. The model of a socio-economic system can be represented in the form of cognitive maps that are directed signed weighted graphs with cause-and-effect relationships and cycles. Identification and selection of target factors and effective control factors of a system is carried out as a solution to the optimal control problem. The influences are determined by the solution to optimization problem of maximizing the objective function, leading to matrix symmetrization. The gear-ratio symmetrization is based on computing the similarity extent of fan-beam structures of the influence spread of vertices vi and vj to all other vertices. This approach provides the real computational domain and correctness of solving the optimal control problem. In addition, it does not impose requirements for graphs to be ordering relationships, to have a matrix of special type or to fulfill stability conditions. In this paper, determination of new metrics of vertices, indicating and estimating the extent and the ability to effectively control, are likewise offered. Additionally, we provide experimental results over real cognitive models in support.",

In particular, it follows that if the feasible set is non-empty and the inequality constraints are convex and separable, then the convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed without any additional assumptions. If the feasible set is empty and the projected gradients of the Lagrangians are forced to go to zero, then the iterates are shown to converge to the nearest well posed problem.",

		"Abstract": "Detections of material regions on CT-scans of solids are commonly treated manually by an expert. Although such manual detections have many advantages, some amount of human error is also incorporated. Moreover, expert opinions may vary significantly. We present an application of the k-means++ clustering as an alternative option to manual way of material area detections. k-means++ clustering is derived from k-means (the method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing), popular for cluster analysis in data mining and image processing communities. The algorithm's main advantages are its simple implementation and fast convergence to a local optimum of an objective function. We benchmark the suggested approach on transverse CT-scans of a fibre-reinforced concrete solid. Moreover, we introduce a technique for processing air distribution, such that the appropriate pixels detected as the pixels of air are converted into pixels representing concrete. The technique is based on the connected component algorithm. Benchmark and results of proposed method conclude the paper.",

		"Abstract": "The paper deals with a solution of large multibody contact problems using massively parallel computers and domain decomposition methods. These methods can solve the problems discretized by billions of nodal variables at the cost nearly proportional to the number of variables using up to thousands cores before the communication costs start to dominate the computational costs. The paper describes the ingredients essential for efficient massively parallel implementation that increases the parallel scalability beyond the limit mentioned above. The improvements were enhanced into a new software package PERMON which is based on PETSc. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on the solution of an academic benchmark discretized by nearly billion of nodal variables.",

However, in real engineering applications we cannot avoid uncertainties caused by measurement errors. In the Bayesian approach every unknown or inaccurate value is treated as a random variable. This paper presents an application of the Bayesian inverse approach to the reconstruction of a porosity field as a parameter of the Darcy flow problem. However, this framework can be applied to a wide range of problems that involve some amount of uncertainty. Here the material field is modeled as a Gaussian random field, which is expressed as a function of several random variables. The information about these random variables is given by the resulting posterior distribution, which is then studied using the Cross-Entropy method and samples are generated using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.",

We divide the solution of the problem into two parts. The first one is the decomposition of a random field into a sum of products of a random vector and a function of spatial coordinates; this can be achieved using the Karhunen-Loeve expansion. The second part is the solution of the problem using SGM. SGM is a simple extension of the Galerkin method in which the random variables represent additional problem dimensions. For the discretization of the problem, we use a finite element basis for spatial variables and a polynomial chaos discretization for random variables. The results of SGM can be utilised for the analysis of the problem, such as the examination of the average flow, or as a tool for the Bayesian approach to inverse problems.",

A choice of the system is usually limited to Gaussian-type orbitals due to the impossibility of the analytical evaluation of necessary integrals using other basis types. Unfortunately, it is not possible to use direct discretization techniques due to the dimensionality of the problem so the numerical integration is problematic. Tensor Numerical Methods overcome this problem by using special data representations, which are discussed. Finally, it is demonstrated how to use these methods to construct a tensor approximation of Slatertype orbital basis functions including an error estimate and its numerical verification.",

		"Abstract": "Medical images are increasingly used within healthcare for diagnosis, planning treatment, and monitoring disease progression. The images acquired at different times, with different imaging modalities, from different subjects etc. often provide an additional clinical information that is not revealed in the separate images. The spatial relation between the images has to be found and this process is called image registration. In our contribution, we use elastic registration which assumes that the images are two different observations of an elastic body which is discretized by the finite element method. We are especially interested in the problems where the requirements on the registration prevent the application of standard FFT based solvers to the solution of auxiliary linear problems, which is the case when the part of the two observations can be related by a rigid body motion. Because the medical images usually contain a large area of background and a small area of changes, a regular discretization results in waste of computational resources due to the fine refinement of the space outside the region of interest (especially in 3D). To avoid this, we use coarser grid with local refinement that takes into account specific features of the images and their differences. The related elasticity problems are solved by TFETI, which is a variant of the Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting (FETI) domain decomposition method for massively parallel numerical solution of elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDE) with optimal complexity.",

We say that f is a distance magic labeling of G if the weight of every vertex is the same constant k and we say that f is a handicap magic labeling of G if the weight of every vertex v is `+f(v) for some constant `. Graphs that allow such labelings are called distance magic or handicap, respectively. Distance magic and handicap labelings of regular graphs are used for scheduling incomplete tournaments. While distance magic labelings correspond to so called equalized tournaments, handicap labelings can be used to schedule incomplete tournaments that are more challenging to stronger teams or players, hence they increase competition and yield attractive schemes in which every game counts. We summarize known results on distance magic and handicap labelings and construct a new infinite class of 4-regular handicap graphs.",

		"Abstract": "This article focuses on the functionality verification of a novel non-invasive fibre-optic sensor monitoring basic vital signs such as Respiratory Rate (RR), Heart Rate (HR) and Body Temperature (BT). The integration of three sensors in one unit is a unique solution patented by our research team. The integrated sensor is based on two Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) encapsulated inside an inert polymer (non-reactive to human skin) called PolyDiMethylSiloxane (PDMS). The PDMS is beginning to find widespread applications in the biomedical field due to its desirable properties, especially its immunity to ElectroMagnetic Interference (EMI). The integrated sensor\u2019s functionality was verified by carrying out a series of laboratory experiments in 10 volunteer subjects after giving them a written informed consent. The Bland-Altman statistical analysis produced satisfactory accuracy for the respiratory and heart rate measurements and their respective reference signals in all test subjects. A total relative error of 0.31 % was determined for body temperature measurements. The main contribution of this article is a proof-of-concept of a novel noninvasive fiber-optic sensor which could be used for basic vital sign monitoring. This sensor offers a potential to enhance and improve the comfort level of patients in hospitals and clinics and can even be considered for use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) environments.",

		"Abstract": "Water quality and its fast and reliable monitoring is the challenge of the future. Design of appropriate biosensors that would be capable of non-invasive identification of water pollution is an important prerequisite for such challenge. Chlorophylls are pigments, naturally presented in all plants that absorb light. The main forms of chlorophyll in algae are chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, other pigments include xantophylls and beta-carotenes. Our aim was to characterize endogenous fluorescence of the Chlorella sp. algae, present naturally in drinking water. We recorded spatial, spectral and lifetime fluorescence distribution in the native algae. We noted that the fluorescence was evenly distributed in the algae cytosol, but lacked in the nucleus and reached maximum at 680\u2013690 nm. Fluorescence decay of chlorella sp. was double-exponential, and clearly shorter than that of its isolated pigments. For the first time, fluorescence lifetime image of the algae is presented. Study of the fluorescence properties of algae is aimed at the improvement of water supply contamination detection and cleaning.",

		"Abstract": "In the paper the technological factors influencing test structure gate length were described. The influence of test structure gate placement (Schottky metallization between ohmic contacts, on mesa and on GaN surface) was analyzed and discussed. Moreover, various distances between ohmic contacts paths were tested. Except for experimental investigations, simulations using finite elements method in COMSOL were performed for the same structure. The modelling results revealed crucial impact of a gap beyond the mask on the electric field distribution in photoresist layer. The smallest value of relative error of test finger lengths was observed for finger parts placed between ohmic paths on mesas. It was explained by thicker lift-off double layer between ohmic paths and the smallest Y-gap compared to test fingers placed on mesa and outside of it. Simulation did not bring an explanation of larger values of relative error for smaller distance between ohmic paths.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents torque ripple reduction with speed control of 8/6 Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) by the determination of the optimal parameters of the turn on, turn off angles (\u0398on, \u0398off), and the supply voltage using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and steady state Genetic Algorithm (ssGA). With SRM model, there is difficulty in the control relapsed into highly non-linear static characteristics. For this, the Finite Elements Method (FEM) has been used because it is a powerful tool to get a model closer to reality. The mechanism used in this kind of machine control consists of a speed controller in order to determine current reference which must be produced to get the desired speed, hence, hysteresis controller is used to compare current reference with current measured up to achieve switching signals needed in the inverter. Depending on this control, the intelligent routing algorithms get the fitness equation from torque ripple and speed response so as to give the optimal parameters for better results. Obtained results from the proposed strategy based on metaheuristic methods are compared with the basic case without considering the adjustment of specific parameters. Optimized results found clearly confirmed the ability and the efficiency of the proposed strategy based on metaheuristic methods in improving the performances of the SRM control considering different torque loads.",

		"Abstract": "Application of equipment with power electronic converter interface such as distributed generation, FACTS and HVDC, is growing up intensively. On the other hand, various types of topologies have been proposed and each of them has some advantages. Therefore, appropriateness of each converter regarding to the application is a main question for designers and engineers. In this paper, a part of this challenge is responded by comparing a typical Voltage-Source Converter (VSC) and Z-Source Converter (ZSC), through high power electronic-based equipment used in power systems. Dynamic response, stability margin, Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of grid current and fault tolerant are considered as assessment criteria. In order to meet this evaluation, dynamic models of two converters are presented, a proper control system is designed, a small signal stability method is applied and responses of converters to small and large perturbations are obtained and analysed by PSCAD/EMTDC.",

		"Abstract": "The direct contact of a tree or a branch of tree with Covered Conductors (CC) overhead lines causes Partial Discharges (PD) inside the insulation. The presence of PD degrades the insulation systems and eventually destroys insulation, which may lead to power delivery interruption. The detection and diagnosis of PD is an important tool to address the problem of tree caused faults in forested terrains. The PD occurs in the impulse component of the signal, which is usually measured by Rogowski coil (current signal) or single layer inductors (voltage signal). In this paper, we introduce a possibility to detect the tree caused faults with the usage of whip antenna. The advantage of the antenna is a very low price and the possibility to install antenna under voltage. The disadvantages are sensitivity to ferromagnetic materials and impossibility to distinguish affected phase. The measurements were carried out in the real environment in forested terrain in Jeseniky Mountains. The real environment is different from a laboratory conditions due to heavy noise (e.g. corona, radio emissions). This paper provides an examination of the background noise from the antenna signal. The experimental results indicate that the antenna may be successfully used instead of the current approach.",

		"Abstract": "This article presents a linear model predicting optimal size of Distributed Generation (DG) that addresses the minimum power loss. This method is based fundamentally on strong coupling between active power and voltage angle as well as between reactive power and voltage magnitudes. This paper proposes simplified method to calculate the total power losses in electrical grid for different distributed generation sizes and locations. The method has been implemented and tested on several IEEE bus test systems. The results show that the proposed method is capable of predicting approximate optimal size of DG when compared with precision calculations. The method that linearizes a complex model showed a good result, which can actually reduce processing time required. The acceptable accuracy with less time and memory required can help the grid operator to assess power system integrated within large-scale distribution generation.",

		"Abstract": "This paper describes the phenomenon of reliability of power plants. It gives an explanation of the terms connected with this topic as their proper understanding is important for understanding the relations and equations which model the possible real situations. The reliability phenomenon is analysed using both the exponential distribution and the Weibull distribution. The results of our analysis are specific equations giving information about the characteristics of the power plants, the mean time of operations and the probability of failure-free operation. Equations solved for the Weibull distribution respect the failures as well as the actual operating hours. Thanks to our results, we are able to create a model of dynamic reliability for prediction of future states. It can be useful for improving the current situation of the unit as well as for creating the optimal plan of maintenance and thus have an impact on the overall economics of the operation of these power plants.",

		"Abstract": "With the continuous scaling down of technology in the field of integrated circuit design, low power dissipation has become one of the primary focuses of the research. With the increasing demand for low power devices, adiabatic logic gates prove to be an effective solution. This paper briefs on different adiabatic logic families such as ECRL (Efficient Charge Recovery Logic), 2N-2N2P and PFAL (Positive Feedback Adiabatic Logic), and presents a new proposed circuit based on the PFAL logic circuit. The aim of this paper is to simulate various logic gates using PFAL logic circuits and with the proposed logic circuit, and hence to compare the effectiveness in terms of average power dissipation and delay at different frequencies. This paper further presents implementation of C17 and C432 benchmark circuits, using the proposed logic circuit and the conventional PFAL logic circuit to compare effectiveness of the proposed logic circuit in terms of average power dissipation at different frequencies. All simulations are carried out by using HSPICE Simulator at 65 nm technology at different frequency ranges. Finally, average power dissipation characteristics are plotted with the help of graphs, and comparisons are made between PFAL logic family and new proposed PFAL logic family.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents torque ripple reduction with speed control of 8/6 Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) by the determination of the optimal parameters of the turn on, turn off angles (\u0398on, \u0398off), and the supply voltage using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and steady state Genetic Algorithm (ssGA). With SRM model, there is difficulty in the control relapsed into highly non-linear static characteristics. For this, the Finite Elements Method (FEM) has been used because it is a powerful tool to get a model closer to reality. The mechanism used in this kind of machine control consists of a speed controller in order to determine current reference which must be produced to get the desired speed, hence, hysteresis controller is used to compare current reference with current measured up to achieve switching signals needed in the inverter. Depending on this control, the intelligent routing algorithms get the fitness equation from torque ripple and speed response so as to give the optimal parameters for better results. Obtained results from the proposed strategy based on metaheuristic methods are compared with the basic case without considering the adjustment of specific parameters. Optimized results found clearly confirmed the ability and the efficiency of the proposed strategy based on metaheuristic methods in improving the performances of the SRM control considering different torque loads.",

		"Abstract": "This article describes the design and the functional verification of fiber optic system with an innovative non-invasive measuring probe for monitoring respiratory and heart rate. The measuring probe is based on Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG), and it is encapsulated in the PolyDiMethylSiloxane polymer (PDMS). PDMS offers a unique combination of suitable properties for the use in biomedical applications. The main advantages include inert to human skin and immunity to electromagnetic interference. The measuring probe is a part of contact strip which is placed on the chest of the patient. The measurement is based on sensing the movements of the thoracic cavity of the patient during breathing. Movement (mechanical stress) is transferred to FBG using the contact strip. Respiratory and heart rate are analyzed using the spectral evaluation of the measured signals. This monitoring method is fully dielectric; thus the absolute safety of the patient is ensured. The main contributions of the article are a design of non-invasive probe encapsulated into a PDMS polymer and implementation of the probe for humans using a contact strip. This combination forms an essential element of the measuring system. The set of experimental measurements verified functionality with respect to the position of the patient. Performed experiments proved the functionality of the presented solution so it can be utilized for further research in biomedical applications.",

		"Abstract": "We report on germania and alumina dopant profile shift effects at preparation of compact optical fibers using packaging methods (Stack-and-Draw method, Rod-in-Tube (RiT) technique). The sintering of package hollow volume by viscous flow results in a shift of the core-pitch ratio in all-solid microstructured fibers. The ratio is increased by about 5 % in the case of a hexagonal package. The shift by diffusion effects of both dopants is simulated for typical slow speed drawing parameters. Thermodynamic approximations of surface dissociation of germania doped silica suggest the need of an adequate undoped silica barrier layer to prevent an undesired bubble formation at fiber drawing. In contrast, alumina doping does not estimate critical dissociation effects with vaporous aluminium oxide components. We report guide values of diffusion length of germania and alumina for the drawing process by kinetic approximation. The germania diffusion involves a small core enlargement, typically in the submicrometer scale. Though, the alumina diffusion enlarges it by a few micrometers. A drawn pure alumina preform core rod transforms to an amorphous aluminosilicate core with a molar alumina concentration of only about 50 % and a non-gaussian concentration profile.",

		"Abstract": "Optical Access Networks (OAN) mostly use optical splitters to distribute the services from Optical Line Terminal (OLT) on the provider\u2019s side to the subscribers in Optical Network Unit (ONU). Optical splitters are the key components in such access networks as for example GPON and XG-PON by ITU-T. In this paper we investigate the optical properties of 1\u00d716 Y-branch splitter and 1\u00d716 MMI splitters based on different widths of multimode interference section and different lengths of the output ports. These two splitters were designed, simulated and the obtained results of both were studied and compared with each other. Additionally, we show that the used standard waveguide core size (usually 6\u00d76 \u00b5m2 to match the diameter of the single mode input/output fibers, i.e. to keep the coupling loses as low as possible) supports not only propagation of the single mode but of the first mode too, leading to an asymmetric splitting ratio (increasing non-uniformity of split power over all the output waveguides). Decreasing waveguide core size, it is possible to suppress presence of the first mode and this way to reduce non-uniformity.",

The EN 50160 standard defines the voltage characteristics of electricity supplied by the public distribution system and it is a problem for a distribution network operator when the voltage quality in the distribution network does not comply with the requirements of the EN 50160 standard because of complaints about voltage quality. Such a complaint is justified and the distribution network operator has to pay a penalty and has to remedy the situation. This paper describes a problem of flicker in the medium-voltage distribution grid when the flicker is produced by one customer operating a forging press.

		"Abstract": "Medium-Voltage (MV) overhead lines with Covered Conductors (CCs) are increasingly being used around the world primarily in forested or dissected terrain areas or in urban areas where it is not possible to utilize MV cable lines. The CC is specific in high operational reliability provided by the conductor core insulation compared to Aluminium-Conductor Steel-Reinforced (ACSR) overhead lines. The only disadvantage of the CC is rather the problematic detection of faults compared to the ACSR. In this work, we consider the following faults: the contact of a tree branch with a CC and the fall of a conductor on the ground. The standard protection relays are unable to detect the faults and so the faults pose a risk for individuals in the vicinity of the conductor as well as it compromises the overall safety and reliability of the MV distribution system. In this article, we continue with our previous work aimed at the method enabling detection of the faults and we introduce a method enabling a classification of the fault type. Such a classification is especially important for an operator of an MV distribution system to plan the optimal maintenance or repair the faulty conductors since the fall of a tree branch can be solved later whereas the breakdown of a conductor means an immediate action of the operator.",

The model works with data reflecting the quantity and type of the input biomass to determine the potential energy and offer a selection from various co-generation units. Other important input parameters comprise fermentors and mainly the material composition of their walls to help with determination of heat losses. The input parameters are accompanied by the energetic balance model for a Biogas Station (BPS) concerned. The next section of this paper provides verification of the model with respect to an actual BPS subject to a series of measurements. These measurements focus on electric and heat parameters. The outcome from these measurements was then used to obtain the energetic balance figure. The comparison of measurement results against the model produces slight deviations of the model from the real biogas station only. This paper has been processed pursuant to a long-term research on biogas stations. The biogas station model will be developed further to obtain a more detailed energetic balance for the biogas station.",

High voltage transformers play a very important role in the electric power system. One of the most important parts of electric power equipment is the insulation system. Insulation system must be in a good condition for reliable and safe operation of electrical devices. Insulation system of electrical equipment is exposed to various factors which could have negative influence on its condition. Oil impregnated insulation paper is one of the oldest insulation systems used in electrical power equipment. Mineral oils have been used for decades as transformer fluids because of their excellent dielectric properties and availability. However, performance of mineral oil starts to be limited due to environmental consideration. The aim of this paper is to simulate a real insulation system of transformer and to show the influence of accelerated thermal ageing on the insulation system. Properties such as relative permittivity, dissipation factor and the breakdown voltage will be described and analysed.",

		"Abstract": "Squirrel cage induction machine are the most commonly used electrical drives, but like any other machine, they are vulnerable to faults. Among the widespread failures of the induction machine there are rotor faults. This paper focuses on the detection of broken rotor bars fault using multi-indicator. However, diagnostics of asynchronous machine rotor faults can be accomplished by analysing the anomalies of machine local variable such as torque, magnetic flux, stator current and neutral voltage signature analysis. The aim of this research is to summarize the existing models and to develop new models of squirrel cage induction motors with consideration of the neutral voltage and to study the effect of broken rotor bars on the different electrical quantities such as the park currents, torque, stator currents and neutral voltage. The performance of the model was assessed by comparing the simulation and experimental results.

		"Abstract": ". One of the most frequent faults in PMSM stator is the insulation failure due to the degradation of the main isolation in the motor winding. This paper is aimed at suggesting a dynamic model of PMSM with phase-to-phase fault based on an equivalent electric circuit model including the real form of back EMF. The faulty model is used for studying the machine behavior and extracting the fault signatures for diagnosis. Two diagnostic techniques the Spectral Analysis (ESA) and Extend Park\u2019s Vectors Approach (EPVA) based on frequency analysis are applied to detect this kind of fault.",

		"Abstract": "DC-DC Quadratic Buck Converter (QBC) is largely used in applications where the high step-down conversion ratio is required. In the practical implementation, QBC is subject to uncertainties, disturbance, and sensor noise. To address the QBC control problems, a two-degree of freedom PID (2-DOF PID) is designed in the robust control framework. Further, for comparison purpose, a one-degree of freedom PID (1-DOF PID) and mixed sensitivity loopshaping (MS-LS) controller are also proposed. Considering QBC parasitic components, the QBC smallsignal transfer function is derived based on a practical approach. Sensitivity functions are used to specify the desired design requirements, and non-smooth optimization is used to tune both PID\u2019s parameters. The three control structures are implemented and tested in the Matlab/Simulink environment. As attested by simulation results, the 2-DOF PID exhibits a better regulation accuracy with enhanced robust stability and robust performance for a wide range of supply voltage/load variation and sensor noise effect.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, a high resolution of 16 bit and high speed of 125 MS\u00b7s \u22121 , multibit Pipelined ADC with digital background calibration is presented. In order to achieve low power, SHA-less front end is used with multibit stages. The first and second stages are used here as a 3.5 bit and the stages from third to seventh are of 2.5 bit and last stage is of 3-bit flash ADC. After bit alignment and truncation of total 19 bits, 16 bits are used as final digital output. To remove linear gain error of the residue amplifier and capacitor mismatching error, a digital background calibration technique is used, which is a combination of Signal Dependent Dithering (SDD) and butterfly shuffler. To improve settling time of residue amplifier, a special circuit of voltage separation is used. With the proposed digital background calibration technique, the Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) has been improved to 97.74 dB @ 30 MHz and 88.9 dB @ 150 MHz, and the signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) has been improved to 79.77 dB @ 30 MHz, and 73.5 dB @ 150 MHz. The implementation of the Pipelined ADC has been completed with technology parameters of 0.18 \u00b5m CMOS process with 1.8 V supply. Total power consumption is 300 mW by the proposed ADC.",

		"Abstract": "Fiber-optic sensors offer an attractive option to existing sensors for the measurement of the vehicle speed in road traffic. This article describes the measuring scheme of two interferometric sensor units including input-output components for the measurement of the vehicle speed. The interferometric sensors operate on a principle of Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The sensors are constructed to detect a vibration caused by vehicles moving on roads. The sensor system processes the vibrational response, and the vehicle speed is calculated in a time domain. DFB laser was used with a wavelength of 1550 nm and output power of 1\u2013 5 mW. The solution provides very high sensitivity. The performance of the proposed system was verified by a series of experimental measurements of the speed. The vehicle speed was monitored by GPS. The highest relative difference of the evaluated speed against GPS data was 7.7 %, the smallest was 1.36 %. When recalculated on kph, the absolute error ranged in the tolerance of \u00b13 kph, which denotes segmental measuring systems in CZE.",

In last decades, developing a new method for improving lumen output and Angular Color Uniformity (ACU) is the main direction in LED technology. In this paper, an innovative approach for enhancing lighting performance (lumen output and angular color uniformity) of Multi-Chip White LED lamps (MCWLEDs) was proposed and demonstrated by mixing the green Ce0.67Tb0.33MgAl11O19: Ce,Tb (CeTb) phosphor into their phosphor compounding. With varying CeTb concentration, ACU and lumen output with Conformal Phosphor Package (CPP) and In-cup Phosphor Package (IPP) are calculated, displayed and analyzed. The results show that the lumen output and the ACU of 7000 K and 8500 K MCW-LEDs increased remarkably in comparison with the older works. Using green CeTb is a prospective method for improving lighting performance of MCW-LEDs in future.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, we evaluate performances of various user selection protocols under impact of hardware impairments. In the considered protocols, a Base Station (BS) selects one of available Users (US) to serve, while the remaining USs harvest the energy from the Radio Frequency (RF) transmitted by the BS. We assume that all of the US randomly appear around the BS. In the Random Selection Protocol (RAN), the BS randomly selects a US to transmit the data. In the second proposed protocol, named Minimum Distance Protocol (MIND), the US that is nearest to the BS will be chosen. In the Optimal Selection Protocol (OPT), the US providing the highest channel gain between itself and the BS will be served. For performance evaluation, we derive exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions of average Outage Probability (OP) over Rayleigh fading channels. We also consider average harvested energy per a US. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations are then performed to verify the theoretical results.",

		"Abstract": "Digital watermarking has been one of the focal points of research interests in order to provide multimedia security in the last decade. Watermark data, belonging to the user, are embedded on an original work such as text, audio, image, and video and thus, product ownership can be proved. Various robust watermarking algorithms have been developed in order to extract/detect the watermark against such attacks. Although watermarking algorithms in the transform domain differ from others by different combinations of transform techniques, it is difficult to decide on an algorithm for a specific application. Therefore, instead of developing a new watermarking algorithm with different combinations of transform techniques, we propose a novel and effective watermark extraction and detection method by pre-filtering, namely Adaptive Unsharp Masking (AUM). In spite of the fact that Unsharp Masking (UM) based pre-filtering is used for watermark extraction/detection in the literature by causing the details of the watermarked image become more manifest, effectiveness of UM may decrease in some cases of attacks. In this study, AUM has been proposed for pre-filtering as a solution to the disadvantages of UM. Experimental results show that AUM performs better up to 11\\% in objective quality metrics than that of the results when pre-filtering is not used. Moreover; AUM proposed for pre-filtering in the transform domain image watermarking is as effective as that of used in image enhancement and can be applied in an algorithm-independent way for pre-filtering in transform domain image watermarking.",

		"Abstract": "Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) is the most distributed type of fiber-optic sensors. FBGs are primarily sensitive to the effects of temperature and deformation. By employing different transformation techniques, it is possible to use FBG to monitor any physical quantity. To use them as parts of sensor applications, it is essential to encapsulate FBGs to achieve their maximum protection against external effects and damage.  Another reason to encapsulate is increasing of sensitivity to the measured quantity. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) encapsulation appears to be an interesting alternative due to convenient temperature and flexibility of the elastomer. This article describes an experimental proposal of FBG PDMS encapsulation process, also providing an analysis of the FBG spectral characteristics and temperature sensitivity, both influenced by high temperature and the process of polydimethylsiloxane curing itself. As for the PDMS type, Sylgard 184 was employed. Encapsulation consisted of several steps: allocation of FBG to PDMS in its liquid state, curing PDMS at the temperature of 80\u00b0C \u00b1 5 %, and a 50-minute relaxation necessary to stabilize a Bragg wavelength. A broadband light source and an optical spectrum analyzer were both used to monitor the parameters during the processes of curing and relaxation. Presented results imply that such a method of encapsulation does not have any influence on the structure or functionality of the FBG. At the same time, a fourfold increase of temperature sensitivity was monitored when compared to a bare FBG.",

		"Abstract": "Power system blackouts are very infrequent, but they have a Brobdingnagian effect on the system performance and devices. The present research work offers remarkable techniques for the assessment of temporary overvoltages all through the re-energization of network lines. The main goal of this research work is to first-rate and reenergize the network lines for the purpose of restoration. In the later stage, the magnitudes and durations of the Temporary Overvoltages (TOVs) that occurred during the energization of unloaded transformer are estimated.The assortment and re-energization of network lines is done on the basis of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and conceptual method respectively. The assessment of TOVs is done on the basis of MATLAB/Simulink and Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs). The proposed models are verified on IEEE 30 bus test system for the analysis purpose. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (%MAPE) obtained through various forecasting methods is examined to check the robustness of the proposed approaches. The simulation and FFNN results presented in this research work helps in designing the exact withstand voltage rating for various network components employed at the moment of re-energization.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents the application of modified cuckoo search algorithm (MCSA) for solving economic load dispatch (ELD) problems. The MCSA method is developed to improve the search ability and solution quality of the conventional CSA method. In the MCSA, the evaluation of eggs has divided the initial eggs into two groups, the top egg group with good quality and the abandoned group with worse quality. Moreover, the value of the updated step size in MCSA is adapted as generating a new solution for the abandoned group and the top group via the Levy flights so that a large zone is searched at the beginning and a local zone is foraged as the maximum number of iterations is nearly reached. The MCSA method has been tested on different systems with different characteristics of thermal units and constraints. The result comparison with other methods in the literature has indicated that the MCSA method can be a powerful method for solving the ELD.",

		"Abstract": "Efficiency improvement is an important challenge for electric motor driven systems. For an induction motor, operation under rated conditions (at rated load with rated flux) is very efficient. However, in many situations, operation with rated flux causes low efficiency especially at light load ranges. In these applications, induction motor should operate at reduced flux which causes a balance between iron losses and copper losses leading to an improved efficiency. This paper concerns energy optimization, i.e. efficiency improvement is carried out via a controller designed on the basis of imposing the rated power factor, by finding a relationship between rotor flux and torque current component which can optimize the compromise between torque and efficiency in steady state as well as in transient state. Experimental results are presented to prove the effectiveness and validity of the proposed controller.",

The parameters of synchronous generator, both cylindrical rotor and salient pole rotor, are estimated based on the circuit model. Genetic algorithm based parameter estimation technique is adopted where only one set of in-situ measured load test data is used. Conventional methods viz., EMF, MMF, Potier triangle method uses rated voltage and rated current obtained from more than one operating condition to determine the parameters. However, Genetic Algorithm (GA) based method uses the working voltage and load current of a single operating point obtained from in-situ measured load test data to estimate the parameters. The test results of the GA based parameter estimation method are found to be closer to direct load test results and better than conventional methods.",

		"Abstract": "The paper describes speed estimators for a speed sensorless induction motor drive with the direct torque and flux control. However, the accuracy of the direct torque control depends on the correct information of the stator resistance, because its value varies with working conditions of the induction motor. Hence, a stator resistance adaptation is necessary. Two techniques were developed for solving this problem: model reference adaptive system based scheme and artificial neural network based scheme. At first, the sensorless control structures of the induction motor drive were implemented in Matlab-Simulink environment. Then, a comparison is done by evaluating the rotor speed difference.  The simulation results confirm that speed estimators and adaptation techniques are simple to simulate and experiment. By comparison of both speed estimators and both adaptation techniques, the current based model reference adaptive system estimator with the artificial neural network based adaptation technique gives higher accuracy of the speed estimation.",

The idea was to utilize the hidden chaotic dynamics in pseudo-random sequences given by chaotic map to help Differential evolution algorithm in searching for the best controller settings for the same chaotic system. The optimizations were performed for three different required final behavior of the chaotic system, and two types of developed cost function.

Analyses of the dynamic changes in interferometric patterns were a basis for this method. Also the signal maximum amplitude was measured and compared with the noise background. Perimeter disruptions can be detected by Bragg gratings due to its large deformation sensitivity in transversal or perpendicular directions. The result is then evaluated in the spectral domain. In terms of detected persons it showed very good results. The combination of these sensors was chosen for monitoring both the static and dynamic phenomena. Author's aim is to take advantage of both devices' positive properties. Thus, the system has the abilityto identify people due to frequency analysis in case of interferometers as well as dynamic weighting thanks to Bragg gratings.",

		"Abstract": "Increase of bandwidth demand in data networks, driven by the continuous growth of the Internet and the increase of bandwidth greedy applications, raise the issue of how to support all the bandwidth requirements in the near future. Three optical switching paradigms have been defined and are being investigated: Optical Circuit Switching (OCS); Optical Packet Switching (OPS); and Optical Burst Switching (OBS). Among these paradigms, OBS is seen as the most appropriate solution today. However, OBS suffers from high burst loss as a result of contention in the bufferless mode of operation. This issue was investigated by Coutelen et al., 2009 who proposed the loss-free CAROBS framework whereby signal convertors of the optical signal to the electrical domain ensure electrical buffering. Convertors increase the network price which must be minimized to reduce the installation and operating costs of the CAROBS framework.An analysis capturing convertor requirements, with respect to the number of merging flows and CAROBS node offered load, was carried out. We demonstrated the convertor location significance, which led to an additional investigation of the shared wavelength convertors scenario. Shared wavelength convertors significantly decrease the number of required convertors and show great promise for CAROBS. Based on this study we can design a CAROBS network to contain a combination of simple and complex nodes that include none or some convertors respectively, a vital feature of network throughput efficiency and cost.",

		"Abstract": "An organic-inorganic hybrid solar cell was fabricated using Titanium dioxide (TiO2): 2,5-bis(5-tert-butyl-2-benzoxazolyl) thiophene (BBOT) film and Copper Phthalocyanine (CuPc) as a sensitizer. BBOT was used in photodetector in other reported research works, but as per best of our knowledge, it was not implemented in solar cells till date. The blend of TiO2: BBOT blend was used to fabricate the film on ITO-coated glass and further a thin layer of CuPc was coated on the film. This was acted as photoanode and another ITO coated glass with a platinum coating was used as a counter electrode (cathode). An optimal blend of acetonitrile (solvent) (50-100%), 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (10-25%), iodine (2.5-10%) and lithium iodide, pyridine derivative and thiocyanate was used as electrolytes in the hybrid solar cell. The different structural, optical and electrical characteristics were measured. The Hybrid solar cell showed a maximum conversion efficiency of 6.51%.",

		"Abstract": "The searching and utilization of new energy sources and technologies is a current trend. The effort to increase the share of electricity production from renewable energy sources is characteristic for economically developed countries. The use of accumulation of electrical energy with a large number of decentralized storage units is most preferred, as well as the focus on the production of energy at the point of its consumption. Modern cogeneration units are a good example. This paper describes the accumulation of electrical energy for equalizing the power balance of electric charging stations with high instantaneous power. The possibility of re-utilization of electrical energy from the charged vehicle in the case of lack of electricity in the power grid is solved at the same time. This paper also deals with the selection of appropriate concept of accumulation system and its cooperation with both renewable and distribution networks. Details of the main power components including the results obtained from the system implementation are also described in this paper.",

		"Abstract": "Renewable energy resources represent a noticeable part of the overall energetic concept development. New integration of renewable energy resources into power grids has a significant impact on the reliability and quality of power supply. The major problem of the photovoltaic and wind power plants is their dependency on weather conditions, since it has a direct effect on their immediate output produced that shows stochastic behaviour. These stochastic outputs result in very adverse impacts on the power grid. Further development of these resources could lead to exceeding of the control and absorption abilities of the power grid. The power grid must be set in balance with respect to the production and consumption of electric power at any time. The operation of photovoltaic power plants impair keeping this balance. That has an adverse impact on the very operation and maintenance of network parameters within the extent required. This survey deals with analysis focused on operation of the photovoltaic power plants with respect to the increase of reserve power in ancillary services in the Czech Republic.",

		"Abstract": "Recently, due to the adoption of power reforms, there is a marked increase of contracted power that flows in the transmission line and also the spontaneous power exchanges leading to complex power transmission congestion problems. The appearance of Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices specifically Interline Power Flow Controller (IPFC) has opened up new opportunities to overcome the congestion problem by increasing the possible system load. Hence, the optimal placement of FACTS devices is deservedly an issue of great importance. This paper proposes a Disparity Line Utilization Factor (DLUF) for the optimal placement of IPFC to control the congestion in transmission lines. DLUF determines the difference between the percentage MVA utilization of each line connected to the same bus. The proposed method is implemented for IEEE\u201314 and IEEE-57 bus test system. The IPFC is placed in all possible line combinations of IEEE-14 bus system to check the validity of the proposed methodology. To confirm the generality of the proposed method, the technique is also implemented and verified for IEEE-57 bus test system. An increased load of 110% and 125% is applied, and the results are presented and analysed in detail to establish the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.",

HLN is a combination of Lagrange function and continuous Hopfield neural network where the Lagrange function is directly used as the energy function for the continuous Hopfield neural network. In the proposed method, HLN is used to find a set of non-dominated solutions and a fuzzy based mechanism is then exploited to determine the best compromise solution among the obtained ones. The proposed method has been tested on four hydrothermal systems and the obtained results in terms of total fuel cost, emission, and computational time have been compared to those other methods in the literature. The result comparisons have indicated that the proposed method is favorable for solving the economic emission dispatch problem of fixed-head hydrothermal systems.",

In the simulations the selected propagation models have been proposed at the operating frequency of 1800 MHz for different receiver antenna heights in urban and rural environments. Simulations were performed using MATLAB R2013b. The propagation models depend on location, frequency range and clutter type such as urban, suburban and countryside. It was noticed from the results of the path loss calculation for 2 m, 7 m and 14 m receiver antenna heights in urban environment that COST 231 (W-I) model showed the lowest path loss results (138 dB) as compared with the other models in urban environment. On the contrary, SUI model showed the highest path loss result (166 dB in 2 m receiver antenna height) as compared with the other models in the same environment.",

A 2D or 3D voltage-impedance map of skin is an output of the measuring, interpretation and evaluation process. New pneumatic construction of measuring probe was implemented to achieve a better coverage of specified skin area and get a reduced force range of the touching electrodes allowing the steady contact of the skin-electrode. A skin contact is related to the driving pressure of touching electrodes. Our paper offers experimentally measured results, voltage maps of skin on specific areas, selected measured and described acupuncture points and their applications in electro-acupuncture.",

		"Abstract": "The reliability improvement of no-break redundant electrical systems is the first aim of the proposed strategy. The failure of some UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) system may lead to the fire occurrence. The most used electrical configurations are presented and discussed in the paper. The innovation of the proposed method consists of taking into account the fire risk to improve the accuracy of wiring configuration and component\u2019s failure rate. Thorough research on MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) data has been performed for each wiring component and UPS. The fire risk is taken into account introducing an equivalent fire block in the Reliability Block Diagram scheme; it has an MTBF value calculated form yearly statistics of UPS fire events. The reliability of the most used UPS electrical configurations is evaluated by means of the RBD method. Different electrical systems have been investigated and compared based on MTBF. The importance of fire compartmentation between two or more UPS\u2019 connected in parallel is proved here.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, we present a modified inter-view prediction Multiview Video Coding (MVC) scheme from the perspective of viewer's interactivity. When a viewer requests some view(s), our scheme leads to lower transmission bit-rate. We develop an interactive multiview video streaming system exploiting that modified MVC scheme. Conventional interactive multiview video systems require high bandwidth due to redundant data being transferred. With real data test sequences, clear improvements are shown using the proposed interactive multiview video system compared to competing ones in terms of the average transmission bit-rate and storage size of the decoded (i.e., transferred) data with comparable rate-distortion.",

The most effective data transmission can be achieved by powerful reservation protocols, which are together with optical switches very important parts of high-speed optical networks. This paper deals with new reservation protocol called Search & Compare, which is designed according to the well-known Segment-based Robust Fast Optical Reservation Protocol. In this paper, we present time analyses of both reservation protocols. We focused mainly on intra-segment time analyses. During the reservation of network resources, we used the optical cross-connect as the core node, which is based on microelectromechanical system and semiconductor optical amplifier.

The Ti/Al/Ni/Au contact to AlGaN/GaN heterostructures fabricated by metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy was examined using three methods i.e. etching of annealed contact metallization, fractures (prepared at room temperature and after a bath in liquid nitrogen) and microsections imaging. The main focus was on the estimation of reaction range on the metal-semiconductor interface of samples. In the first method, the surface of AlGaN/GaN heterostructure after etching of metallization was studied by an optical microscope, scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope. The changes of surface morphology of heterostructure directly reflect solid state reactions range between metallization and semiconductor. The range of reactions was also observed using the small-angle microsections method while the fractures analysis did not bring valuable information.",

		"Abstract": "Nowadays, the most used biofuel in Slovak republic is log wood. Alternatively, there are also biofuels based on vegetal biomass (phytomass) like wheat straw or grass. The advantage of these biofuels is lower cost price because they are usually considered as waste product. The major disadvantage of these vegetal biofuels is their problematic combustion. It is mainly due to the low ash melting temperature because of chemical composition of ash from phytomass. The low ash melting temperature causes slagging and sintering, which reduce the efficiency of the combustion process. This disadvantage causes very difficult and problematic combustion of phytomass. The article deals the way of trouble reduction during combustion of pellets made from phytomass (specific hay) through the wood pellet co-combustion in a standard automatic boiler for combustion of wood pellets. During the experiments, the mixing ratio of hay pellets and wood pellets is varied and subsequently, there is determined its impact on the combustion process, namely on heat output of the boiler, and there is also evaluated the effect of the mixing ratio on the production of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2), organic hydrocarbons (OGC) and particulate matters (PM10, PM2.5).",

		"Abstract": "This paper proposes an efficient Cuckoo-Inspired Meta-Heuristic Algorithm (CIMHA) for solving multi-objective short-term hydrothermal scheduling (ST-HTS) problem. The objective is to simultaneously minimize the total cost and emission of thermal units while all constraints such as power balance, water discharge, and generation limitations must be satisfied. The proposed CIMHA is a newly developed meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by the intelligent reproduction strategy of the cuckoo bird. It is efficient for solving optimization problems with complicated objective and constraints because the method has few control parameters. The proposed method has been tested on different systems with various numbers of objective functions, and the obtained results have been compared to those from other methods available in the literature. The result comparisons have indicated that the proposed method is more efficient than many other methods for the test systems in terms of total cost, total emission, and computational time. Therefore, the proposed CIMHA can be a favorable method for solving the multi-objective ST-HTS problems.",

		"Abstract": "Conventional techniques for sensorless control of permanent magnet synchronous motor drive (PMSM), which requires information on rotor position, are reviewed, and recent developments in this area are introduced in this paper along with their inherent advantages and drawbacks. The paper presents an improved method for sensorless speed control of PMSM drive with emphasis placed on signal injection method. This signal injection method examines the control performance of sensorless PMSM drive by injecting signal externally and thereby sensing the rotor position. The main objective of this drive system is to have speed control at standstill and low speed regions. Several tests are carried out to demonstrate the ability of proposed models at different operating conditions with the help of simulation results in Matlab/Simulink environment. Simulation results confirm that the proposed sensorless control approach of PMSM can achieve high performance at standstill and low speeds but not at very high speeds. An experimental setup is implemented using a 1HP surface mounted (SM) PMSM and DsPICDEM^TM MCHV-2 development board, to check the validity of simulation results.",

		"Abstract": "Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) bring advanced applications that provide innovative services for various transportation modes in the area of traffic control, and enable better awareness for different users. Communication connections between intelligent vehicles with the use of wireless communication standards, so called Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), require ensuring verification of validity of provided services as well as services related to transmission confidentiality and integrity. The goal of this paper is to analyze secure mechanisms utilised in VANET communication within Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) with a focus on safety critical applications. The practical part of the contribution is dedicated to modelling of security properties of VANET networks via OPNET Modeler tool extended by the implementation of the OpenSSL library for authentication protocol realisation based on digital signature schemes. The designed models simulate a transmission of authorised alert messages in Car-to-Car communication for several traffic scenarios with recommended Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES). The obtained results of the throughput and delay in the simulated network are compared for secured and no-secured communications in dependence on the selected digital signature schemes and the number of mobile nodes. The OpenSSL library has also been utilised for the comparison of time demandingness of digital signature schemes based on RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman), DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) and ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) for different key-lengths suitable for real time VANET communications for safety-critical applications of C-ITS.",

		"Abstract": "Scaling of the MOSFET face greater challenge by extreme power density due to leakage current in ultra deep sub-micron (UDSM) technology. To overcome from this situation double gate device like FinFET is used which has excellent control over the thin silicon fins with two electrically coupled gate, which mitigate shorter channel effect and exponentially reduces the leakage current. In this research paper utilize the property of FinFET in domino logic, for high speed operation and reduction of power consumption in wide fan-in OR gate. Proposed circuit is simulated in FinFET technology by BISM4 model using HSPICE at 32nm process technology at 250C with CL=1pF at 100MHz frequency. For 8 and 16 input OR gate we save average power 11.5%,11.39% in SFLD, 22.97%, 18.12% in HSD, 30.90%, 34.57% in CKD in SG mode and for LP mode 11.26%, 15.78% in SFLD, 19.74%, 17.94% in HSD, 45.23%, 34.69% in CKD respectively",

		"Abstract": "In the design of new components for passive optical networks (PONs), the non-ideal properties are worth considering. In this paper the influence of interface roughness and temperature changes on final transmittance of downstream channels blocking filters for next generation dense wavelength division multiplexing passive optical networks(DWDM-PONs) is shown. The transmittance as the filter transfer characteristicswas calculated with the transfer matrix method. The roughness was expressed by root mean square deviations from an ideally smooth surface and was taken into account in the modified Fresnel coefficients. It is demonstrated how the interfacial roughness may increase the insertion loss and decrease the channel bandwidth which results in reduction of transmitted light energy through the filter.",

		"Abstract": "Properties of wide bandgap semiconductors as chemical inertness to harsh conditions and possibility of working at high temperature ensure possible applications in the field as military, aerospace, automotive, engine monitoring, flame detection and solar UV detection. Requirements for ohmic contacts in semiconductor devices are determined by the proposed application. These contacts to AlGaN/GaN heterostructure for application as high temperature, high frequency and high power devices have to exhibit good surface morphology and low contact resistance. The latter is a crucial factor in limiting the development of high performance AlGaN/GaN devices. Lowering of the resistance is assured by rapid thermal annealing process. The paper present studies of Ti/Al/Mo/Au ohmic contacst annealed at temperature range from 825\u00b0C to 885\u00b0C in N2 atmosphere. The electrical parameters of examined samples as a function of the annealing process condition have been studied. Initially the annealing temperature increase caused lowering of the contacts resistance. The lowest value was noticed for the temperature of annealing equal to 885\u00b0C. Further increase of annealing temperature led to deterioration of contact resistance of investigated ohmic contacts.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, a comprehensive design for a 100kW/400V, three-phase pulse-width modulated (PWM) AC-DC converter is presented that serves as the front-end power supply for wide-range varying active load. This power supply includes two series stages; a six-switch AC-DC boost converter and a DC-DC buck converter to regulate 400VDC at load side. The design of all inductors and capacitors is fulfilled using mathematical expressions. In addition, small signal modelling and controller design are presented in order to raise the design efficiency of the proposed converter. Also, due to the high power application, improved soft-switching techniques are applied. Furthermore, systematic approach to design an input EMI filter for DC-DC converter is explained. The simulation results performed by PSCAD software show that high performance of the proposed power supply is obtained in terms of stability, high power factor, high efficiency and low total harmonic distortion (THD).",

The active filter is based on a three-leg split-capacitor voltage source inverter which is used to compensate harmonics and unbalance in the phase currents, and therefore to cancel neutral current. The proposed sliding mode control is formulated from the multivariable state model established in dq0 frames. The selection of the sliding mode functions takes in account simultaneously, the current tracking and the dc-bus regulation and balancing, without the need of outer loops for the dc-bus control. A particular attention is given to the sliding mode functions design in order to optimize the convergence of the zero-sequence error and the dc-bus voltage unbalance. The effectiveness of the proposed control has been verified through computer simulation where satisfactory results are obtained over different conditions.",

With Antenna Selection techniques, the increased hardware complexity due to multiple antennas and large number of RF chains can be reduced to a substantial amount, retaining the diversity benefits of MIMO systems. The channel Correlation also affects the capacity of MIMO fading channels. Hence, to evaluate the upper bounds of capacity through fading channels, performance of MIMO systems is exemplified under Nakagami-m and Rayleigh fading channels while considering that the channel characteristics are known at a transmitter. The obtained results give an assessment to the better understanding to the effect of antenna selection and correlation on the capacity of MIMO channels, and how they can be used in different fading environments.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents a new concept as a special type of virtualization of particular event based communication components in RFID ecosystems. The new approach is containers based virtualization, and it is applied and tested on the container of Object name service. The results of the experiment allowed us to do the preliminary analysis of security consequences on the isolated containerized DNS-based RFID sub-service. We confirmed feasibility with this sandboxing technology represented by the special container.  They bring the benefits in terms of efficient software component life-cycle management and integrity improvements. Experiments results of the containerization are discussed to show the possible isolation ways of other components like EPCis and middleware. There is present evaluation towards external threats and vulnerabilities. The result is a higher level of integrity, availability of whole ecosystem and resiliency against external threats. This gives a new opportunity to build robust RFID as Platform as a service, and it proves the ability to achieve a positive impact on the end to end service Quality of service.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper the improved Congestion Aware Multipath Routing algorithm is analysed in terms of Core network throughput and longer paths contribution. The algorithm discovers unused network resources and dynamically adapts to the actual traffic load and available resources displacement. Several simulation scenarios have been benchmarked in order to verify algorithm in typical Internet Service Provider cases. Simulation scenarios in this paper are focused on verifying functionality in dense core networks. For this purpose, tests were performed on TeraStream based network \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Deutsche Telekom Group design concept. Simulation results have proven better performance and resource utilization of the proposed algorithm than traditional Bellman-Ford based algorithms and equal cost multipath approaches.",

The FlowPing tool is not limited to reach-ability or round trip time testing but is capable of complex UDP based throughput stress testing with rich reporting capabilities on client and server sides. Our new tool implements features, which allow the user to perform tests with variable packet size and traffic rate. All these features can be used in one single test run. This allows the user to use and develop new methodologies for network throughput and stress testing. With the FlowPing tool, it is easy to perform the test with the slowly increasing the amount of network traffic and monitor the behavior of network when the congestion occurs.",

		"Abstract": "The immense growth of client requirements imposed on data centre and cloud providers results in a conflict with traditional networking concepts lacking the required agility. In order to promote flexibility, which data centre providers promise to their clients, this discrepancy needs to be resolved, for instance by employing the novel concept of Software-Defined Networking (SDN). This paper utilises this concept in order to minimise service downtime while performing live virtual machine migration. The work is aimed at small/medium-sized data centres and hence the findings are based on real communication patterns found in such environments. Results show that packet loss is slightly diminished while available throughput is increased thanks to the proactive approach taken during network topology changes when compared to the traditional approach based on L2 forwarding.",

Our metric is based on observing if connections or transmissions are successfully finished or not. It is possible to optimize this metric for specific situations.

		"Abstract": "Recently increasing interest in multimedia services leads to requirements for quality assessment, especially in the video domain. There are many factors that influence the video quality. Compression technology and transmission link imperfection can be considered as the main ones. This paper deals with the assessment of the impact of H.265/HEVC compression standard on the video quality using subjective metrics. The evaluation is done for two types of sequences with Full HD resolution depending on content. The paper is divided as follows. In the first part of the article, a short characteristic of the H.265/HEVC compression standard is written. In the second part, the subjective video quality methods used in our experiments are described. The last part of this article deals with the measurements and experimental results. They showed that quality of sequences coded between 5 and 7 Mbps is for observers sufficient, so there is no need for providers to use higher bitrates in streaming than this threshold. These results are part of a new model that is still being created and will be used for predicting the video quality in networks based on IP.",

The system is based on the open source projects and is useful as a design tool for VoIP system administrators. The paper compares the most used codecs from the transcoding perspective. The multiple transcoding between G711, GSM and G729 codecs were performed and the speech quality of these calls was evaluated. The speech quality was measured by Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality method, which provides results in Mean Opinion Score used to describe the speech quality on a scale from 1 to 5. The obtained results indicate periodical speech quality degradation on every transcoding between two codecs.",

To date, publications have concentrated on the determination of the maximum number of fiber Bragg gratings on one optical fiber using wavelength and time division multiplexing. In this paper, these techniques will be extended to determine the spectral width of wavelength division multiplexing in terms of the spectral width of the light emitting diode, the spectral width of the Bragg gratings, the measurement ranges of the individual sensors, and the guard band between two adjacent Bragg gratings. For time division multiplexing, a description of the time and power conditions are given. In particular the reflected power, first order crosstalk and chromatic dispersion have been considered. Finally, these relationships were applied to verify a design in a simulation using OptiSystem software.",

Basic building modules of classical call centers \u2013 a switching system and a group of humans agents \u2013 was extended with other special modules such as skills-based routing module, automatic call distribution module, interactive voice response module and others to minimize the customer waiting time and wage costs. A calling customer of a modern call center is served in the first stage by the interactive voice response module without any human interaction. If the customer requirements are not satisfied in the first stage, the service continues to the second stage realized by the group of human agents. The service time of second stage \u2013 the average handle time \u2013 is divided into a conversation time and wrap-up time. During the conversation time, the agent answers customer questions and collects its requirements and during the wrap-up time (administrative time) the agent completes the task without any customer interaction.

		"Abstract": "In this paper, we present a cluster-dependent adaptation approach for HMM-based acoustic models. The proposed approach employs clustering techniques to group the original training utterances into clusters with predefined number. The clustered speech data are intended to adapt an initially pre-trained acoustic model to the specific cluster by reestimation based on the standard Baum-Welch procedure. The resulting model, adapted to the homogeneous data may markedly improve the baseline recognition rate, whereas the model complexity may be reduced. In the recognition step, the test samples are scored by each adapted model and the most accurate one is chosen. The proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated in Slovak triphone-based large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) system. The results prove that the cluster-sensitive retraining leads to significant improvements over the baseline reference system trained according to the conventional training procedure.",

		"Abstract": "A multi-level classification architecture for solving binary discrimination problem is proposed in this paper. The main idea of proposed solution is derived from the fact that solving one binary discrimination problem multiple times can reduce the overall miss-classification error. We aimed our effort towards building the classification architecture employing the combination of multiple binary SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifiers for solving two-class discrimination problem. Therefore, we developed a binary discrimination architecture employing the SVM classifier (BDASVM) with intention to use it for classification of broadcast news (BN) audio data. The fundamental element of BDASVM is the binary decision (BD) algorithm that performs discrimination between each pair of acoustic classes utilizing decision function modeled by separating hyperplane. The overall classification accuracy is conditioned by finding the optimal parameters for discrimination function resulting in higher computational complexity. The final form of proposed BDASVM is created by combining four BDSVM discriminators supplemented by decision table. Experimental results show that the proposed classification architecture can decrease the overall classification error in comparison with binary decision trees SVM (BDTSVM) architecture.",

		"Abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach of person identification using acoustical monitoring of typing the required word on the monitored keyboard. This experiment was motivated by the idea of COST IC1106 (Integrating Biometrics and Forensics for the Digital Age) partners to acoustically analyse the captured keystroke dynamics database using widely used time-invariant mathematical models tools. The MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) and HMM (Hidden Markov Models) was introduced in this experiment, which gives promising results of 99.33% accuracy, when testing 25% of realizations (randomly selected from 100) identifying between 50 users/models. The experiment was repeated for different training/testing configurations and cross-validated, so this first approach could be a good starting point for next research including feature selection algorithms, biometric authentication score normalization, different audio & keyboard setup tests, etc.",

		"Abstract": "Nowadays, in the EU a lot of project concerning broadband access to the Internet for end users is being developed. The aim of those projects is to support the creation of access communication networks that can meet defined performance criteria for providing the broadband services. Such networks are in general called Next Generation Access. One of the first tasks is to identify appropriate transmission technologies that could meet the required performance criteria. For each transmission technology, it is necessary to carry out a detailed performance analysis of the transmission depending on certain transmission conditions. To perform a detailed analysis means to carry out modelling of transmission\u2019s specific conditions for each technology. This article, specifically, discusses hybrid optical networks, which in conjunction with digital subscriber lines are one of the possible solutions for Next Generation Access. In the access network topology that combines copper and optical cables, it is necessary to optimize the mutual ratio of both infrastructure\u2019s length. Therefore, the article also describes this issue that refers to a certain technology for the Next Generation Access. Specific performance criteria of transmission for access network in the Czech Republic are considered and the optimized location of the external node digital line access multiplexer is discussed.",

		"Abstract": "Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) have been used by attackers for over two decades because of their effectiveness. This type of the cyber-attack is one of the most destructive attacks in the Internet. In recent years, the intensity of DDoS attacks has been rapidly increasing and the attackers combine more often different techniques of DDoS to bypass the protection. Therefore, the main goal of our research is to propose a DDoS solution that allows to increase the filtering capacity linearly and allows to protect against the combination of attacks. The main idea is to develop the DDoS defense system in the form of a portable software image that can be installed on the reserve hardware capacities. During a DDoS attack, these servers will be used as filters of this DDoS attack. Our solution is suitable for data centers and eliminates some lacks of commercial solutions. The system employs modular DDoS filters in the form of special grids containing specific protocol parameters and conditions.",

In the second approach, we want to find more concrete rain-rate dependency with using linear regression.

		"Abstract": "This paper presents the analysis, design and manufacture of a low cost, low maintenance and long-range prototype of RFID transponder with continuous operability. A prototype of semi-active RFID transponder is produced with a range that can be extended via a DC input to allow all of the readers signal power to be reflected via backscatter modulation. The transponder is powered via solar harvested power which is selected over other energy harvesting technologies as it provides a greater energy density and lower cost. Solar has one major drawback in terms of providing a steady DC voltage in it needed a constant supply of sunlight. A method of power storage is proposed, and the use of a supercapacitor over a rechargeable battery is used as it has a longer lifespan due to higher recharge rates. The prototype underwent a series of experiments in various working environments and proves an effective solution in providing long lasting operability. The paper concludes the use of solar harvesting with supercapacitor storage has potential for further uses in external remote sensors used in the Internet of Things.",

It applies aggregation strategies in the area monitored by sensor nodes to reduce the number of reports sent to sink and to save energy. The basic idea is to weight the information sensed by sensors based on the distortion area in order to estimate better the event at the sink node. This approach seeks to exploit the spatial correlation among nodes and among clusters to assign different importance to the information aggregated and forwarded by the cluster head nodes. A multi-zone monitoring related to clusters is proposed, and a dynamic weights management is presented to consider distortion at cluster level introduced in the event estimation. A mathematical formulation of the problem and the proposal to weight space and data information is led out. Simulation campaigns in Matlab show the effectiveness of the event estimation in terms of event estimation distortion and network lifetime.",

The first solution is based on sinus table, truncated onto 32 values. This solution uses 8-bit PORTD for value intended to external D/A converter. The second one solution exploits compare facilities of PIC18F46K22, only two pins of microcontroller are needed for described application. And the third solution is similar to the second, difference consists in exploiting of PWM microcontroller hardware. Presented solutions were created in context of works on dotation program \"Support of Science and Research in Moravia-Silesia Region\".",

		"Abstract": "High-utility itemset mining (HUIM) is a critical issue in recent years since it can be used to reveal the profitable products by considering both the quantity and profit factors instead of frequent itemset mining (FIM) of association rules (ARs). In this paper, an evolutionary algorithm is presented to efficiently mine high-utility itemsets (HUIs) based on the binary particle swarm optimization. A maximal pattern (MP)-tree strcutrue is further designed to solve the combinational problem in the evolution process. Substantial experiments on real-life datasets show that the proposed binary PSO-based algorithm has better results compared to the state-of-the-art GA-based algorithm.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, a novel face recognition system for face recognition and identification based on a combination of Principal Component Analysis and Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (P-KCCA) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed. First, the P-KCCA method is utilized to detect and extract the important features from the input images. This method makes it possible to match the 2D face image with enrolled 3D face data. The resulting features are then classified using the SVM method. The proposed methods were tested on TEXAS database with 200 subjects. The experimental results in the TEXAS face database produce interesting results from the point of view of recognition success, rate, and robustness of the face recognition algorithm. We compare the performance of our proposed face recognition method to other commonly-used methods. The experimental results show that the combination of P-KCCA method using SVM achieves a higher performance compared to the alone PCA, CCA and KCCA algorithms.",

		"Abstract": "With the ongoing steady traffic increase in the Internet, the wavelength usage of the supporting optical networks is a critical network efficiency parameter. Therefore, this paper suggests a way how to efficiently and economically achieve this goal in the context of optical burst switching, a very promising technology that has been proposed to overcome the shortcomings of conventional WDM deployment, such as lack of fine bandwidth granularity in wavelength routing and electronic speed bottlenecks in the presence of bursty traffic. In order to mitigate the burst loss and achieve high network efficiency we adapt the loss-less paradigm defined by Coutelen et al. (2010), i.e., the CAROBS framework. In classical OBS networks, the streamline effect ensures a very low level of contention, i.e., efficient transmission, hence we define a routing guided only by the streamline effect. The resulting routing problem is formulated as an optimization model which is solved using a decomposition technique to increase the scalability of the solution process.",

A feedback-based fuzzy control with h-infinity tracking performance and a concept of virtual reference model  are combined to develop a fuzzy tracking controller capable to track a reference signal and ensure a minimum effect of disturbance on the PMSM system. First, a T-S fuzzy model is used to represent the PMSM nonlinear system with disturbance. Next, an integral fuzzy tracking control based on the concept of virtual desired variables (VDVs) is formulated to simplify the design of the virtual reference model and the control law. Finally, based on this concept, a two-stage design procedure is developed: i) determine the VDVs from the nonlinear system output equation and generalized kinematics constraints ii) calculate the feedback controller gains by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the validity and the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

		"Abstract": "In recent years, the authors have developed what appears to be a very successful phenomenological model for analyzing the role of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. In this paper, we extend the scope of the model by using it to predict the generation of new frequencies from networks tuned to a specific frequency, or indeed not self-oscillatory at all. We have discussed two principal cases: firstly where the constituent systems are coupled in an excitatory-excitatory fashion, which we designate by ``+/+''; and secondly where the constituent systems are coupled in an excitatory-inhibitory fashion, which we designate ``+/-''. The model predicts that from a basic system tuned to tremor frequency we can generate an unlimited range of frequencies. We illustrate in particular, starting from systems which are initially non-oscillatory, that when the coupling coefficient exceeds a certain value, the system begins to oscillate at an amplitude which increases with the coupling strength. Another very interesting feature, which has been shown by colleagues of ours to arise through the coupling of complicated networks based on the physiology of the basal ganglia, can be illustrated by the root locus method which shows that increasing and decreasing frequencies of oscillation, existing simultaneously, have the property that their geometric mean remains substantially constant as the coupling strength is varied. We feel that with the present approach, we have provided another tool for understanding the existence and interaction of pathological oscillations which underlie, not only Parkinson's disease, but other conditions such as Tourette's syndrome, depression and epilepsy.",

		"Abstract": "Mathematical models for description of physical phenomena often use the statistical description of the individual phenomena and solve those using suitable methods. If we want to develop numerical model of optical communication system based on transmission through single mode optical fibres, we need to consider whole series of phenomena that affect various parts of the system. In the single-mode optical fibre we often encounter influence of chromatic dispersion and nonlinear Kerr effects. By observing various different degradation mechanisms, every numerical model should have its own limits, which fulfil more detailed specification. It is inevitable to consider them in evaluation. In this paper, we focus on numerical modelling of degradation mechanisms in single-mode optical fibre. Numerical solution of non-linear Schroedinger equation is performed by finite difference method applied in MATLAB environment and split-step Fourier method, which is implemented by VPIphotonics software.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents the reliability improvement with effect of customer scattering on distribution system with Distributed Generation (DG). The test system is studied in six different cases based on different customer scattering patterns. Each customer scattering case is analyzed for finding the reliability indices of the distribution system without DG, and with installation of DG at various locations along the feeder. In addition, the algorithm for assessment of average restoration time of load point is presented when DG is installed.  The proposed algorithm is tested on a simple system consists of nine load points. The reliability improvement is measured by reliability indices that include SAIFI, SAIDI, CAIDI, ENS and AENS. On the other hand it provides some useful conclusions such as the customer scattering and restoration time effect the optimal location of DG in terms of system reliability.",

		"Abstract": "This paper proposes a control scheme of back-to-back PWM converters for the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) wind turbine system. The DC-link voltage can be controlled at the machine-side converter (MSC), while the grid-side converter (GSC) controls the grid active power for a maximum power point tracking (MPPT). At the grid fault condition, the DC-link voltage controller is designed using a feedback linearization (FL) theory. For the MPPT, a proportional control loop is added to the torque control to reduce the influence of the inertia moment in the wind turbines, which can improve its dynamic performance. The validity of this control algorithm has been verified by the simulation of the 2-MW PMSG wind turbine system.",

In this paper, the moderation of inverter controlling techniques has been adopted to intensify the DVR characteristics and thereby to improve the Power Quality. The proposed model verification has been obtained by simulation of the PWM patterns which provides the better utilization of the device (DVR) for the compensation of voltage deviations during voltage sag. Also, it has been shown that Dynamic Voltage Restorer can be worked as a harmonic compensator for the compensation of the current and voltage harmonics. Obtained simulation results verify that the control approach gives very effective regulation and performs excellent voltage compensation by adopting multilevel inverter.",

		"Abstract": "The large-scale penetration of distributed, Renewable power plants require transfers of large amounts of energy. This, in turn, puts a high strain on the energy delivery infrastructure. In particular, photovoltaic power plants supply energy with high intermittency, possibly affecting the stability of the grid by changing the voltage at the plant connection point. In this contribution, we summarize the main negative effects of selected and real-operated grid connected photovoltaic plant. Thereafter a review of suitable Energy storage systems to mitigate the negative effects has been carried out, compared and evaluated using Multi-criterion analysis. Based on this analysis, data collected at the plant and the grid, are used to design the energy storage systems to support connection of the plant to the grid. The cooperation of these systems is then analysed and evaluated using simulation tools created in LabVIEW for this purpose. The simulation results demonstrate the capability of energy storage system solutions to significantly reduce the negative feedback effects of Photovoltaic Power Plan to the low voltage grid.",

PlanetLab is a global research network with the main purpose to support development of new Internet services and protocols.

The nodes are accessible by remote login, and the users can run their software on the nodes. In the paper, we study the PlanetLab's properties that are significant for its use as a geographically distributed testbed. This includes node position accuracy, services availability and stability. We find a considerable number of location inaccuracies and a number of services that cannot be considered as reliable.

		"Abstract": "Recently, a new xDSL successor called G.fast, which can occupy frequencies up to 106 or 212~MHz, has been introduced in ITU-T G.9700 series of recommendations. Moreover, a new model of transmission characteristics suitable for various types of metallic cables has been designed and described as well. The model is based on 9 parameters specified for each type of metallic cable and can provide accurate estimations. However, its complexity together with the number of required parameters makes its practical application questionable, since the most important metallic cable characteristic, the attenuation, can be estimated using much simpler models. Therefore, two innovative attenuation models suitable for frequencies up to 250 MHz were designed and they will be introduced in this paper. The main motivation was to achieve an accurate approximation of attenuation character for various types of metallic cables, while maintaining low mathematical complexity and a number of necessary parameters. Both models were compared with attenuation characteristics measured for variety types of real metallic cables and also with other standard attenuation models. The results are included in this article as well.",

		"Abstract": "Sensed signals from the human body provide information about the health status. The basic clinical methods used for the diagnosis of neural disorders include electroencephalography (EEG). There are a number of algorithms for automatic localization of epileptic graphoelements. Currently, the most widespread disease of the brain is epilepsy which can be diagnosed by using EEG. We will further deal with three following methods: simple arithmetic detector, detector based on median filtering and the combined application of previous methods.",

		"Abstract": "This paper reports on the structural and electrical properties of LiPO3 glass over a wide range of frequencies (10 Hz - 2 MHz) and temperatures (290 K -627 K). The temperature dependence of a.c. conductivity is studied at different frequencies. The d.c. conductivity is due to the hopping of lithium ions. A theoretical model and mathematical fit of conductivity measurements are used for characterization of the ionic hopping motion connected with the mobility of conducting Li+ ions. The acoustic attenuation spectroscopy can be useful technique for the study of relaxation processes in ion conducting glasses too. Raman experiments showed the rings and chains configuration at the medium range.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, a fuzzy sliding-mode observer, which uses sigmoid function for speed sensorless control of permanent-magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) is proposed. Most of the observers use sign or saturation functions that need low pass filter in order to detecting back electromotive force. In this paper, the sigmoid function is used instead of discontinuous sign function to decrease undesirable chattering phenomenon. By reducing the chattering, detecting back EMF can be done directly from switching signal without any low pass filter. So the delay time because of low pass filter, in the proposed observer is eliminated. Furthermore, there is no need to compensate phase fault in position estimating. The simulation results show advantages of proposed observer over conventional ones.",

Expressions to calculate EMI spectrum and attenuation are derived.

		"Abstract": "This paper presents one of the solutions to the problem of multipath propagation and effects on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals in urban canyons. GNSS signals may reach a receiver not only through Line-of-Sight (LOS) paths, but they are often blocked, reflected or diffracted from tall buildings, leading to unmodelled GNSS errors in position estimation. Therefore in order to detect and mitigate the impact of multipath, a new ray-tracing model for simulation of GNSS signals reception in urban canyons is proposed - based on digital 3D maps information, known positions of GNSS satellites and an assumed position of a receiver. The model is established and validated using experimental, as well as real data. It is specially designed for complex environments and situations where positioning with highest accuracy is required - a typical example is navigation for blind people.",

		"Abstract": "Conventional methods for computing 3D projects are nowadays usually implemented on standard or graphics processors. The performance of these devices is limited especially by the used architecture, which to some extent works in a sequential manner. In this article we describe a project which utilizes parallel computation for simple projection of a wireframe 3D model. The algorithm is optimized for a FPGA-based implementation. The design of the numerical logic is described in VHDL with the use of several basic IP cores used especially for computing trigonometric functions. The implemented algorithms allow smooth rotation of the model in two axes (azimuth and elevation) and a change of the viewing angle. Tests carried out on a FPGA Xilinx Spartan-6 development board have resulted in real-time rendering at over 5000fps. In the conclusion of the article, we discuss additional possibilities for increasing the computational output in graphics applications via the use of HPC (High Performance Computing).",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, the path following problem of an omnidirectional mobile robot (OMR) has been studied. Unlike nonholonomic mobile robots, translational and rotational movements of OMRs can be controlled simultaneously and independently. However the constraints of translational and rotational velocities are coupled through the OMR's orientation angle. Therefore, a combination of a virtual-vehicle concept and a model predictive control (MPC) strategy is proposed in this work to handle both robot constraints and the path following problem. Our proposed control scheme allows the OMR to follow the reference path successfully and safely, as illustrated in simulation experiments. The forward velocity is close to the desired one and the desired orientation angle is achieved at a given point on the path, while the robot's wheel velocities are maintained within boundaries.",

After a brief introduction dealing with amplifiers and doped fibers in general we focus on the assembly of our own EDFA amplifier with standard construction and the IsoGain I-6 amplifying fiber, and on the parameters of its individual components. Since an erbium doped fiber has usually no direct thermal stabilization, temperature changes can affect performance of the entire amplifier. The next part of the article therefore describes the impacts of such changes on behaviour of our amplifier. At the very end we performed a measurement of the amplifier deployed in the actual WDM-PON the description of which can be found in the last chapter.",

Prepared preform was drawn into single-mode optical fiber with a numerical aperture 0.167. Optical and luminescence properties of the fiber were analyzed. Lasing ability of prepared fiber was proofed in a fiber-ring set-up. Optimal laser properties were achieved for a fiber length of 20~m. The slope efficiency of the fiber-laser was about 15%.

However as data rates increase, present electronic switching technology using current data centre architecture is becoming increasingly difficult to scale despite improvements in data management. In this paper the tremendous bandwidth potential of optical fibre based networks will be explored alongside the issues of electronic scalability and switching speed. A resulting need for alternative optical solutions for all-optical signal processing systems will be discussed. With this in mind, progress in the form of a novel and highly scalable optical interconnect will be reviewed.",

		"Abstract": "In hybrid FSO/RF systems, mostly a hard switching mechanism is preferred in case of the FSO signal level falls below to the predefined threshold. In this work, a computationally simple approach is proposed to increase the utilization of the FSO channels bandwidth advantage.  For the channel, clear air conditions have been supposed with the atmospheric turbulence. In this approach, FSO bit rate is adaptively changed to achieve desired BER performance. An IM/DD modulation, OOK (NRZ format) has been used to show the benefit of the proposed method. Furthermore, to be more realistic with respect to the atmospheric turbulence variations within a day, some experimental observations have been followed up.",

		"Abstract": "This article deals with the construction of a modulator and demodulator for Free-Space Optical (FSO) communication. In FSO optics, the modulated optical signal is propagated in the constantly changing environment (atmosphere). The optical signal is strongly influenced by the actual composition of air, which is directly linked to the change in refractive index in the turbulent cells. This article examines primarily the appropriate modulation format for FSO. For this purpose, one type of an OOK-NRZ modulator and one type of a demodulator were designed. This article also describes the construction of two types of photo detectors (the high impedance and the transimpedance ones). All electronic constructions were tested in the MicroCap simulator and they were experimentally measured as well. For the OOK NRZ modulation the, maximum transmission speed achieved the value of 160~Mbps. Measuring the quality of the modulation formats was carried out under mechanical and thermal turbulences. The last part of this work gives the results of the measurements of fog influences.",

		"Abstract": "This article describes wireless optical data networks using visible spectra of optical radiation with a focus on interior areas with direct line of sight LOS (line-of-sight). This type of network represents progressively evolving area of information technologies. Development of lightning technologies based on white power LED was the impulse for wireless optical data networks based on visible spectra of optical radiation (VLC) development. Its basic advantage is the flexibility of users. Users don\u2019t have to stay on one place during the data sharing anymore. Wireless optical data networks represent an alternative solution for metallic and fiber networks [1], [2]. This paper deals with the software simulation of homogeneous distribution of optical irradiation in dark room model, carrying out in LightTools software. First, in previous simulations, the optical source composed from 9 SMD LED\u2019s type LW G6SP-EAFA-JKQL-1 was designed. In various simulations, various numbers and distributions of LED\u2019s were used. These were placed at the ceiling of the dark room.

Even if it is well-known that specially formed substrates as Asahi U-type for solar cells are produced, there is still a continuing attention given to the applications of surface roughness to achieve better light trapping and absorptance in solar cells. It was found out the even an exact interface morphology can play an important role in light trapping.

		"Abstract": "This paper proposes a model based on Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm (FGA) to determine the optimal capacity and location of a DG unit in a radial distribution network. In the FGA, a fuzzy controller is integrated into GA to adjust the crossover and mutation rates dynamically to maintain the proper population diversity during GA's operation. This effectively overcomes the premature convergence problem of the simple genetic algorithm (SGA). The main objective functions considered in this study are maximisation of cost savings arising from energy loss, minimisation of voltage drops across all lines, and maximisation of the transfer capability of the system. The model takes into account the peculiarities of radial distribution networks, such as high R/X ratio, voltage dependency and composite nature of loads. The proposed model is evaluated on three radial test distribution systems, and the results obtained are very impressive, with high computational efficiency, when compared with those of the existing approaches cited in the literature.",

This paper describes structure and behavior of STATCOM/SMES compensator in power systems. A control strategy based on direct Lyapanov method for compensator is used. Moreover, the performance of the STATCOM/SMES compensator in a load variation condition is evaluated by PSCAD/EMTDC software in test system.

		"Abstract": "Stand-alone off-grid power supply system is a necessity for applications when electrical power distribution network is inaccessible. Internal and external subject security aspects should be valued, and the system should be optimized to obtain properly working, never-failing and secure local electrical power supply system. Internal security aspects result from both security concept and used technologies. Internal threats contain fire ignition, flooding, electrical cables melting and other threats arising from intrinsic materials or subsystems characteristics, at standard conditions of use. Additional external aspects include anti-theft protection, breaking doors or windows signaling and countermeasure, weather extremes alert, etc. Both internal and external aspects necessarily induce additional off-grid power system or subject monitoring that might be performed by supervising security subsystem. This paper provides a solution for off-grid security subsystem. It consists from pervasive sensor circuits, fuzzy controlled diagnostics and executive actuators. Cooperated fuzzy logic diagnostic and control device enables to evaluate anticipated threats and dynamically generates the most appropriate decisions about real threat existence that leads to improvement of system protection.

This energetic system was installed and tested in Laboratory of fuel cells that is located in the university campus of VSB-Technical University of Ostrava. The energetic system consists of several basic components: a photovoltaic field, accumulators bank, water commercial electrolyzer and compact fuel cell system. The weather conditions recorded in two different weeks as model weather and solar conditions are used as case studies to test the energetic system and the results for two different cases are compared each other. The results show and illustrate selected behaviour curves of the power system and also average energy storage efficiency for accumulation subsystem based on hydrogen technologies or at the energetic system embedded components.

EEG has a big role in several applications such as in the diagnosis of human brain diseases and epilepsy. Also, we can use the EEG signals to control an external device via Brain Computer Interface (BCI) by our mind. There are many algorithms to analyse the recorded EEG data, but it still remains one of the big challenges in the world. In this article, we extended our previous proposed method. Our extended method uses Self-organizing Map (SOM) as an EEG data classifier. The proposed method we can divide in following steps: capturing EEG raw data from the sensors, applying filters on this data, we will use the frequencies in the range from 0.5~Hz to 60~Hz, smoothing the data with 15-th order of Polynomial Curve Fitting, converting filtered data into text using Turtle Graphic, Lempel-Ziv complexity for measuring similarity between two EEG data trials and Self-Organizing Map Neural Network as a final classifiers.

		"Abstract": "The paper deals with the network robustness from the perspective of nodal centrality measures and its applicability in Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Traditional graph characteristics have been evolving during the last century, and numerous of less-conventional metrics was introduced trying to bring a new view to some particular graph attributes. New control technologies can finally utilize these metrics but  simultaneously show new challenges. SDN brings the fine-grained and nearly online view of the underlying network state which allows to implement an advanced routing and forwarding. In such situation, sophisticated algorithms can be applied utilizing pre-computed network measures. Since in recent version of SDN protocol OpenFlow (OF) has been revived an idea of the fast link failover, the authors in this paper introduce a novel metric, Quality of Alternative Paths centrality (QAP). The QAP value quantifies node surroundings and can be with an advantage utilized in algorithms to indicate more robust paths. The centrality is evaluated using the node-failure simulation at different network topologies in combination with the Quality of Backup centrality measure.",

		"Abstract": "Today, increasing of the transmission rate in a telecommunications network is possible in various ways. One of them is inverse multiplexing. The inverse multiplexer divides a data stream to multiple parallel channels. This principle not only allows to increase the total available transmission rate, but also allows to reduce the error rate and interruption in data stream. The digital subscriber line may be used for the implementation of the inverse multiplex. Accurate knowledge of the transmission parameters of a digital subscriber line and the entire infrastructure of the network provider is necessary for the effective functioning of the terminal device with inverse multiplexing. It is necessary to know not only the parameters related to the transmission rate, but above all the parameters relevant to the time characteristics of data transmission. This paper describes how to obtain the transmission parameters of real digital subscriber lines and their modelling.",

		"Abstract": "Nowadays, packet error rate in fixed networks can be considered as a negligible value. However, the increasing requirements for transmission speed of mobile devices, heterogeneous technology, and other high frequency sources cause interference growth within the electromagnetic spectrum. This affects the overall reliability and throughput of the network and may cause undesirable operation malfunction of application-level services. Higher speeds can be achieved by advanced modulation techniques, but at the price of lower resistance against the interference. On the other hand, error-correcting codes or higher-level protocols are utilized to correct the delivery failures. We introduce a novel method for increasing robustness of communication for multi-homed systems in heterogeneous environment. Furthermore, we propose a security measure to ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability of the transmitted data without influencing the transmission parameters. Finally, we show positive impact of the proposed method on transmission efficiency and effective throughput, especially in networks with high probability of error occurrence.",

The network provides benefits of the Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANET) and Delay Tolerant Network (DTN). The main problem of the MANET occurs if the communication path is broken or disconnected for some short time period. On the other side, DTN allows sending data in the disconnected environment with respect to higher tolerance to delay.  Hybrid MANET - DTN provides optimal solution for emergency situation in order to transport information. Moreover, the security is the critical factor because the data are transported by mobile devices. In this paper, we investigate the issue of secure candidate node selection for transportation of the data in a disconnected environment for hybrid MANET- DTN. To achieve the secure selection of the reliable mobile nodes, the trust algorithm is introduced. The algorithm enables select reliable nodes based on collecting routing information. This algorithm is implemented to the simulator OPNET modeler.",

		"Abstract": "Nowadays one of the hottest theme in wireless environments research is the application of the newest technologies to road safety problems and traffic management exploiting the (VANET) architecture. In this work, a novel protocol that aims to achieve a better traffic management is proposed. The overal system is able to reduce traffic level inside the city exploiting inter-communication among vehicles and support infrastructures also known as (V2V) and (V2I) communications. We design a network protocol called (STMP) that takes advantages of IEEE 802.11p standard. On each road several sensors system are placed and they are responsible of monitoring. Gathered data are spread in the network exploiting ad-hoc protocol messages. The increasing knowledge about environment conditions make possible to take preventive actions. Moreover, having a realtime monitoring of the lanes it is possible to reveal roads and city blocks congestions in a shorter time. An external entity to the (VANET) is responsible to manage traffic and rearrange traffic along the lanes of the city avoiding huge traffic levels.",

When Multipath TCP is used the behavior of this protocol is consistent in situation of adding new sub-flow or removing flow on a faulty line. Different strategies for path selection are possible with great impact on Multipath TCP session performance.

Finally, authors suggest the new hybrid model as a combination of a standard ANN and a moving average for error modeling that is used to enhance the outputs of the network using the error part of the original RBF. Using high-frequency data, they examine the ability to forecast exchange rate values for the horizon of one day.

We applied this method on RFID readers within prepared test environment and confirmed long term intention and recognized trend. Due to regulations limitations, there is not possible to increase output power over defined limits, but there are possibilities to influence reader sensitivity.

		"Abstract": "The main goal of VoIP services is to provide a reliable and high-quality voice transmission over packet networks. In order to prove the quality of VoIP transmission, several approaches were designed. In our approach, we are concerned about on-line monitoring of RTP and RTCP traffic. Based on these data, we are able to compute main VoIP quality metrics including jitter, delay, packet loss, and finally R-factor and MOS values. This technique of VoIP quality measuring can be directly incorporated into IPFIX monitoring framework where an IPFIX probe analyses RTP/RTCP packets, computes VoIP quality metrics, and adds these metrics into extended IPFIX flow records. Then, these extended data are stored in a central IPFIX monitoring system called collector where can be used for monitoring purposes. This paper presents a functional implementation of IPFIX plugin for VoIP quality measurement and compares the results with results obtained by other tools.",

		"Abstract": "Nowadays, there is a quickly growing demand for the transmission of voice, video and data over an IP based network. Multimedia, whether we are talking about broadcast, audio and video transmission and others, from a global perspective is growing exponentially with time. With incoming requests from users, new technologies for data transfer are continually developing. Data must be delivered reliably and with the fewest losses at such high speed. Video quality as part of multimedia technology has a very important role nowadays. It is influenced by several factors, where each of them can have many forms and processing. Network performance is the major degradation effect that influences the quality of resulting image. Poor network performance (lack of link capacity, high network load\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) causes data packet losses or different delivery time for each packet. This work focuses exactly on these network phenomena. It examines the impact of different delays and packet losses on the quality parameters of triple play services, to evaluate the results using objective methods. The aim of this work is to bring a detailed view on the performance of video streaming over IP-based networks.",

Generally DG modelling, depend on its type and controlling circuit, is like either PV or PQ bus. In this paper a three-phase unbalanced power flow model using Newton-Raphson method over a 4 buses power system is implemented.

		"Abstract": "In this paper, an investigation is made on the superiority of fractional PID controller (PI^alpha D^beta) over conventional PID for the cart-servo laboratory set-up. The designed controllers are optimum in the sense of Integral Absolute Error (IAE) and Integral Square Error (ISE). The paper contributes in three aspects: 1) Acquiring nonlinear mathematical model for the cart-servo laboratory set-up, 2) Designing fractional and integer order PID for minimizing IAE, ISE, 3) Analyzing the performance of designed controllers for simulated plant model as well as real plant. The results show a significantly superior performance by PI^alpha D^beta as compared to the conventional PID controller.",

		"Abstract": "Reversible logic circuits have been historically motivated by theoretical research in low-power, and recently attracted interest as components of the quantum algorithm, optical computing and nanotechnology. However due to the intrinsic property of reversible logic, traditional irreversible logic design and synthesis methods cannot be carried out. Thus a new set of algorithms are developed correctly to synthesize reversible logic circuit. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review with comparative study on heuristic based reversible logic synthesis. It reviews a range of heuristic based reversible logic synthesis techniques reported by researchers (BDD-based, cycle-based, search-based, non-search-based, rule-based, transformation-based, and ESOP-based). All techniques are described in detail and summarized in a table based on their features, limitation, library used and their consideration metric. Benchmark comparison of gate count and quantum cost are analysed for each synthesis technique. Comparing the synthesis algorithm outputs over the years, it can be observed that different approach has been used for the synthesis of reversible circuit. However, the improvements are not significant. Quantum cost and gate count has improved over the years, but arguments and debates are still on certain issues such as the issue of garbage outputs that remain the same. This paper provides the information of all heuristic based synthesis of reversible logic method proposed over the years. All techniques are explained in detail and thus informative for new reversible logic researchers and bridging the knowledge gap in this area.",

		"Abstract": "The Japanese Experiment Module\u2013Extreme Universe Space Observatory (JEM-EUSO) is a wide-field (+/-~30\u00b0of aperture) 2.5m refractor telescope to be installed in the International Space Station (ISS). The instrument looks downward from its orbit, into Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s atmosphere, with the main objective of observing ultra-violet (UV) fluorescence light generated by Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) extensive air showers (EAS). It is a frontier particle-physics experiment, the first of its kind. The validation of the technical readiness level of such a complex and unique instrument requires prototypes at several levels of integration. At the highest level, the EUSO-Balloon instrument has been conceived, through French space agency (CNES). At a smaller scale and in suborbital flight, EUSO-Balloon integrates all the sub-systems of the full space JEM-EUSO telescope, allowing end-to-end testing of hardware and interfaces, and to probing the global detection chain and strategy, while improving at the same time our knowledge of atmospheric and terrestrial UV background. EUSO-Balloon will be flown by CNES for the first time from Timmins, Canada; on spring 2014.This article presents the low-voltage power supply (LVPS) subsystem development for the EUSO-Balloon instrument. This LVPS is the fully operational prototype for the space instrument JEM-EUSO. Besides design and construction, all performance tests and integration results with the other involved subsystems are shown.",

Modified SRF theory and fuzzy logic controller technique are incorporated in this modelling. This newly designed controller is connected to a source in order to compensate voltage and current in the two feeders. The expanded concept of UPQC is multi converter-UPQC; this system has two series voltage source converter (VSC) and one shunt VSC connected back to back. In the proposed system, the power can be conveyed from one feeder to another in order to mitigate the voltage sag, swell, interruption and transient response of the system. The control strategies of multi converter-UPQC are designed based on the modified synchronous reference frame theory with fuzzy logic controller. The transient response of the fuzzy logic controller in dc-link voltage controller will be very fast.

		"Abstract": "In various fields of numerical mathematics, there arises the need to compute a generalized inverse of a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix, for example in the solution of contact problems. Systems with semidefinite matrices can be solved by standard direct methods for the solution of systems with positive definite matrices adapted to the solution of systems with only positive semidefinite matrix. One of the possibilities is a modification of Cholesky decomposition using so called fixing nodes, which is presented in this paper with particular emphasise on proper definition of fixing nodes. The generalised inverse algorithm consisting in Cholesky decomposition with usage of fixing nodes is adopted from paper [1]. In [1], authors choose the fixing nodes using Perron vector of an adjacency matrix of the graph which is only a sub-optimal choice. Their choice is discussed in this paper together with other possible candidates on fixing node. Several numerical experiments including all candidates have been done. Based on these results, it turns out that using eigenvectors of Laplacian matrix provides better choice of fixing node than using Perron vector.",

Markov chains are used to describe transitions between the states of the process. The industrial process is described as a graph network.

		"Abstract": "This paper is focused on benefits and limits of intensity and phase modulation formats used in optical communications. The simulation results are obtained using OptSim software environment, employing Time Domain Split Step method. Non-Return to Zero, Return to Zero, Chirped Return to Zero and Carrier-Suppressed Return to Zero formats are compared in terms of Bit Error Rate and spectral efficiency to find the limits for selected transmission network topologies. It is shown that phase modulation formats offer many advantages compared to intensity formats. Differential Phase-Shift Keying and mainly Differential Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying improve the Bit Error Rate and transmission reach, among others. A promising solution is the application of Polarization Division Multiplexing Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying, which primarily benefits in spectral efficiency, estimated reach, optical signal to noise ratio and chromatic dispersion tolerances.",

		"Abstract": "The paper deals with the response of polarization maintaining (PM) fibers upon the variation of the temperature field, on condition both polarization axes are excited. Proper use can be applied in the area of optical fiber thermal field disturbance sensor. For a description of polarization properties the coherent Jones and Muller matrices were used. The Poincare sphere was applied to depict the development of the output of the polarization state of PM fibers for wavelengths 633 nm, 1310 nm and 1550 nm were arranged in a proposed sensor setup and were studied in the laboratory. A wide file of results containing dependencies of phase shift variations upon different configurations of measured PM fiber was obtained. The thermal field disturbance of the PM fiber was applied by an object with defined proportions and a defined range of temperatures. Dependencies of phase shift upon the object\u00b4s temperature, its distance from the fiber and exposed length of PM fiber were measured.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used as an evolutionary tecthniques for the optimal placement of flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices in an interconnected power system. Here two types of FACTS devices has been discussed nemely, Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) and Static Var Compensator (SVC) for the economic operation and to reduce the transmission loss. Reactively loading of the system is taken from base to 200% of base loading and the system performance is observed without and with FACTS devices. Optimal placement of FACTS devices in the system is determined by calculating active and reactive power flow in lines. FACTS devices along with reactive generation of generators and transformer tap setting are used for the power transfer capacity using GA. The proposed approach is applied on IEEE 14 and IEEE 30-bus test systems. Finally the effectiveness of the proposed GA based method of placement of FACTS devices is established by comparing the results with another standard method of optimization like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique.",

The proposed inverse packet multiplexer addresses increase of the speed and reliability of packet transmission to the third layer, and at the same time it increases the stability of the data communication by the regulation of the delay value during the transmission.

		"Abstract": "This article presents a new voltage-mode first order allpass filter (APF) employing voltage differencing transconductance amplifier (VDTA). The advantages of the circuit are that: the circuit description is very compact, consists of merely a VDTA and a capacitor: the phase shift can be electronically adjusted by current bias: it provides the lower THD of the output signal. Without any component matching conditions, the proposed circuit is very appropriate to further develop into an integrated circuit. Moreover, the proposed APF can provide the output current with high output impedance without modification of the circuit topology. The PSpice simulation results are depicted. The given results agree well with the theoretical anticipation. The maximum power consumption is 400\u00b5W at \u00b11.25V power supplies.",

Major imperfection in the physical level properties including random dopant fluctuation and effects of variations in MOSFET's manufacturing process, have been taken into account in the proposed analysis and modeling. The up to dated comprehensive analytical model of statistical variation in MOSFET's parameter has been used as the basis of analysis and modeling. The resulting models have been found to be both analytic and comprehensive as they are the precise mathematical expressions in terms of physical level variables of MOSFET. Furthermore, they have been verified at the nanometer level by using 65~nm level BSIM4 based benchmarks and have been found to be very accurate with smaller than 5 % average percentages of errors. Hence, the performed analysis gives the resulting models which have been found to be the potential mathematical tool for the statistical and variability aware analysis and design of subthreshold MOSFET based VHF circuits, systems and applications.",

		"Abstract": "Cardiac diagnostics based on a solution of the inverse problem of electrocardiography offers new tools for visual assessment of cardiac ischemia. The accuracy of the inverse solution is influenced by fidelity of the patient torso model. As optimum, an individual torso model with real heart shape and position obtained from CT or MRI is desirable. However, imaging is not always available in clinical practice, hence we investigated, if a generic torso shape individually adjusted according to patient\u00e2\u20ac\u0098s chest dimensions, with a simplified heart model placed to a vertical position obtained from inverse localization of the early ventricular activation can result in an inverse solution close to the result obtained with an accurate torso model. Simulated inverse localization of 18 ischemic lesions for 9 subjects showed that the use of individually adjusted generic torso instead of real torso shape led to an acceptable increase of the lesion localization error from 0.7\u00b10.7 cm to 1.1\u00b10.7 cm when accurate heart model was used. However, if simplified heart model was used and placed in a vertical position according to the V2 lead level, the lesion localization error increased to 3.5\u00b10.9 cm. Moving the simplified heart model to a position estimated by the inverse solution decreased the vertical heart positioning error from 1.6\u00b12.3 cm to 0.2\u00b11.2 cm but without adjusting the heart shape and rotation the lesion localization error did not improve and reached 3.7\u00b11.0 cm.",

		"Abstract": "The use of LED for illumination and communication together is more and more interesting with the increasing deployment of LEDs to our homes and industrial buildings. Modulation of this kind of light sources is difficult because of high voltage and current demands. Since the LED configurations and values of current and voltage are different, our universal modulator has to be able to operate even under these circumstances. This paper proposes simple and universal current modulator for LED lighting modulation for frequencies around 1MHz. Main objective is to allow initial testing of different types of High Power LEDs and different photodetector configurations and circuits in diffusive based Free-Space-Optical networks.

The main focus is placed on the analysis of potential negative effects while signals from two and more primary transmitters simultaneously enter to the Gap Filler. In particular, in the measurements the impact of reception cross delayed signals received by the Gap Filler from two adjacent primary transmitters operating in the Single Frequency Network was analysed. The influence of different receive signal levels from two adjacent primary transmitters was also examined. In the conclusion, based on the experiments, the limiting factors useful for individual transmitters in the Single Frequency Network were determined. The analysis and finding the limit parameters can help bradcasters in further setting and debugging of the Gap Filler network. Finally, the described laboratory experiment was also verified under the real SFN network condition in border region Vsetinsko to verify the laboratory findings.",

		"Abstract": "The article deals with detection of network anomalies. Network anomalies include everything that is quite different from the normal operation. For detection of anomalies were used machine learning systems. Machine learning can be considered as a support or a limited type of artificial intelligence. A machine learning system usually starts with some knowledge and a corresponding knowledge organization so that it can interpret, analyse, and test the knowledge acquired. There are several machine learning techniques available. We tested Decision tree learning and Bayesian networks. The open source data-mining framework WEKA was the tool we used for testing the classify, cluster, association algorithms and for visualization of our results. The WEKA is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks.",

The features of the circuit are that; the quality factor and natural frequency can be tuned independently; the circuit description is very simple, consisting of merely one VDTA, one resistor and two capacitors; the pole frequency can be electronically adjusted. Additionally, each function response can be selected by suitably selecting input signals with digital method; the double input voltage is not required. Using only single active element, the proposed circuit is very suitable to further develop into an integrated circuit. The PSPICE simulation results are depicted.

		"Abstract": "The dry rot basidiomycete Serpula lacrymans is the most common and destructive wood decay fungus, which attacks and damages houses and other wooden construction worldwide [1], [2]. Effective chemicals have been developed for remediation and treatment of dry rot outbreaks and for wood preservation against dry rot, but in most cases, control is most economically achieved by environmental management to avoid creating favourable growth conditions for the fungus [3]. Thermal treatment using microwaves represents one of possible approaches in fungal growth control and refurbishment of damaged wooden constructions. One of the possibilities, how to monitor this whole process seems to be the use of Optical fiber DTS (Distribution Temperature Systems). The Optical fiber DTS are unique distributed temperature systems using optical fiber as a sensor. Due to the electromagnetic resistance is this system suitable for the monitoring of these processes. This article deals with application of optical meanders in the temperature measurement during the extermination of basidiomycete Serpula lacrymans using microwave heating. Because of the adverse effect of microwave radiation on all other types of temperature sensors.",

Optical fiber sensors sensitive to the change of the light phase, so-called interferometers referred in this article are one of the most sensitive sensors. Because we are able to detect phase changes with extreme precision, these sensors are thus suitable for demanding applications, where cost is not the main requirement. We have used the Mach-Zehnder configuration. The paper deals with the usage of different types of standard single-mode optical fibers in the civil engineering as an integrated acoustic sensor. Further experiments are focused on the different types of fiber installation methods, such as placement in the mounting foam, into the polystyrene or attachment onto the wooden surface and their effect on the measurements. Through the repeated measurements of harmonic frequencies were obtained information about the usable frequency range and sensitivity of the particular arrangement. Measurement was performed for both cases, where the specific type of fiber or specifically installed fiber was used as the measurement or as the reference. The final evaluation is based both on the experience gained during measurements and also using the statistical calculations.",

In MBS, some base stations (BSs) may form an MBS zone and transmit identical MBS contents simultaneously using the same modulation and coding scheme. Hence, the network has to coordinate the transmission of BSs such that BSs belonging to multiple MBS zones may utilize non-conflict resources to transmit different MBS contents. This paper extends the work in [10] for accommodating MBS zones with different service presence probabilities and various bandwidth requirements. A continuous allocation algorithm and a non-continuous allocation algorithm are presented to allocate resource units for overlapping MBS zones.

		"Abstract": "The paper analyses and experimentally verifies deployment of Ethernet based network technology to enable fault tolerant and timely exchange of data among a number of high voltage protective relays that use proprietary serial communication line to exchange data in real time on a state of its high voltage circuitry facilitating a fast protection switching in case of critical failures. The digital serial signal is first fetched into PCM multiplexer where it is mapped to the corresponding E1 (2\u00a0Mbit/s) time division multiplexed signal. Subsequently, the resulting E1 frames are then packetized and sent through Ethernet control LAN to the opposite PCM demultiplexer where the same but reverse processing is done finally sending a signal into the opposite protective relay. The challenge of this setup is to assure very timely delivery of the control information between protective relays even in the cases of potential failures of Ethernet network itself. The tolerance of Ethernet network to faults is assured using widespread per VLAN Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol potentially extended by 1+1 PCM protection as a valuable option.",

In this work we present our developed real time situation identification model for adaptive service support in vehicular communication networks domain. Our solution is different from the others as it uses additional virtual context information source - information from other vehicles which for our knowledge is not addressed in the past.

		"Abstract": "Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANETs) represent a particular mobile technology that permits the communication among vehicles, offering security and comfort. Nowadays, distributed mobile wireless computing is becoming a very important communications paradigm, due to its flexibility to adapt to different mobile applications. VANETs are a practical example of data exchanging among real mobile nodes. To enable communications within an ad-hoc network, characterized by continuous node movements, routing protocols are needed to react to frequent changes in network topology. In this paper, the attention is focused mainly on the network layer of VANETs, proposing a novel approach to reduce the interference level during mobile transmission, based on the multi-channel nature of IEEE 802.11p (1609.4) standard. In this work a new routing protocol based on Distance Vector algorithm is presented to reduce the delay end to end and to increase packet delivery ratio (PDR) and throughput in VANETs. A new metric is also proposed, based on the maximization of the average Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) level and the link duration probability between two VANET nodes. In order to relieve the effects of the co-channel interference perceived by mobile nodes, transmission channels are switched on a basis of a periodical SIR evaluation. A Network Simulator has been used for implementing and testing the proposed idea.",

All presented methods are implemented and evaluated for various inter-arrival and service times in the mathematical model based on queueing theory. In this article, two methods based on performance parameters (such as utilizations, etc.) and one method based on number of registered subscribers to each of available S-CSCF server are described. The main advantage of third method is that all related information is obtained from traffic analysis through I-CSCF (Interrogating-CSCF) node. Also, the designed methods are compared with other selection algorithms presented in previous research works by others researchers (Hwang et col., Cho et col. or Tirana et col.). The article shows that the implemented methods can optimize the service latency of whole IMS network.",

		"Abstract": "This article discusses a methodology for rating the quality of mobile calls. Majority telecommunications service from the perspective of the whole world is using mobile telephony networks. One of the problems affecting this service and its quality are landscape barriers, which prevent the spread signal. Price and complex construction of classic BTS does not allow their dense distribution. In such cases, one solution is to use OpenBTS technology. Design of OpenBTS is more available, so it can be applied to much more places and more complex points. Purpose of this measurement is a model for effective stations deployment, due to shape and distribution of local barriers that reduce signal power, and thus the quality of speech. GSM access point for our mobile terminals is OpenBTS USRP N210 station. The PESQ method for evaluating of speech quality is compared with the subjective evaluation, which provides Asterisk PBX with IVR call back. Measurement method was taken into account the call quality depending on terminal position. The measured results and its processing bring knowledge to use this technology for more complicated locations with degraded signal level and increases the quality of voice services in telecommunications.",

		"Abstract": "NG-PON systems present optical access infrastructures to support various applications of the many service providers. In the near future, we can expect NG-PON technologies with different motivations for developing of HPON networks. The HPON is a hybrid passive optical network in a way that utilizes on a physical layer both TDM and WDM multiplexing principles together. The HPON network utilizes similar or soft revised topologies as TDM-PON architectures. In this first paper, design requirements for SUCCESS HPON networks are introduced. A main part of the paper is dedicated to presentation of the HPON network configurator that allows configurating and analyzing the SUCCESS HPON characteristics from a viewpoint of various specific network parameters. Finally, a short introduction to the comparison of the SUCCESS and SARDANA HPON networks based on simulation results is presented.",

		"Abstract": "In the paper authors verify two problems of methods of operational research in optical burst switching. The first problem is at edge node, related to the medium access delay. The second problem is at an intermediate node related to buffering delay. A correction coefficient K of transmission speed is obtained from the first analysis. It is used in to provide a full-featured link of nominal data rate. Simulations of the second problem reveal interesting results. It is not viable to prepare routing and wavelength assignment based on end-to-end delay, i.e. link's length or number of hops, as commonly used in other frameworks (OCS, Ethernet, IP, etc.) nowadays. Other parameters such as buffering probability must be taken into consideration as well. Based on the buffering probability an estimation of the number of optical/electrical converters can be made. This paper concentrates important traffic constraints of buffered optical burst switching. It allows authors to prepare optimization algorithms for regenerators placement in CAROBS networks using methods of operational research.",

The proposed system consisting of two-stage converter comprises: input resonant boost converter with AC output, two-phase half-bridge cyclo-converter commutated by HF AC input voltage, and induction or synchronous motor. Such a system with AC interlink, as a whole unit, has better properties as a 3-phase reference VSI inverter: higher efficiency due to soft switching of both converter stages, higher switching frequency, smaller dimensions and weight with lesser number of power semiconductor switches and better price. In comparison with currently used conventional system configurations the proposed system features a good efficiency of electronic converters and also has a good torque overloading of two-phase AC induction or synchronous motors. Design of two-stage multi-element resonant converter and results of simulation experiments are presented in the paper.",

One of the most common solutions used in access networks are xDSL lines, especially ADSL2+ or VDSL2. Although these subscriber lines also use packet communication, there are several differences and mechanisms, which influence their resulting delay. Their delay characteristics are also dependent on the individual settings of each xDSL provider, therefore we decided to investigate this area for typical commercially available lines in Czech Republic. Based on the measured values and experiments with real ADSL2+ lines we also developed a potential modeling method, which is presented in this article as well. The parameters for packet jitter based on the generalized Pareto distribution were modeled.",

		"Abstract": "The aim of this research is to create functional system which eliminates the noise of electrical devices. This system works on active basis, therefore it process parasitic signal itself and use it for elimination of the noise. On the first stage it focuses on elimination of energetic devices with great intensity of noise but with small frequency deviations. The main producers of noise emissions are electrical devices, for example transformers. Nowadays, human health and wellbeing are the priorities connected with every human activity. One of the inseparable factors which have unfavorable effect on human organism is the noise around us. Science and research bring new possibilities how to resist these unfavorable impacts. One of the possibilities is the elimination of noise using antiphase.",

		"Abstract": "Modern Very-High Speed Digital Subscriber Lines (VDSL2) can potentially increase the transmission rates in access networks up to tens of Mbps in both directions. However, the real transmission performance of VDSL2 technology is heavily influenced by real conditions of symmetrical pairs and quads in local metallic cables. This paper is primarily focused on the bridged taps and their influence on transmission performance of VDSL2 lines. The presence of bridged taps can complexly affect resulting attenuation, impedance and also crosstalk characteristics of transmission lines, moreover while this influence may differ for various types of metallic cables. That is why a comparison for several typical cables used in last-mile segments was performed and is presented here. The simulations and calculations presented in this paper are based on ABCD matrices, and thanks to that the simulations can be performed for various scenarios and situations.",

		"Abstract": "With the development of synchronized phasor measurement technology in recent years, it gains great interest the use of PMU measurements to improve state estimation performances due to their synchronized characteristics and high data transmission speed. The ability of the Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) to directly measure the system state is a key over SCADA measurement system. PMU measurements are superior to the conventional SCADA measurements in terms of resolution and accuracy. Since the majority of measurements in existing estimators are from conventional SCADA measurement system, it is hard to be fully replaced by PMUs in the near future so state estimators including both phasor and conventional SCADA measurements are being considered.  In this paper, a mixed measurement (SCADA and PMU measurements) state estimator is proposed. Several useful measures for evaluating various aspects of the performance of the mixed measurement state estimator are proposed and explained. State Estimator validity, performance and characteristics of the results on IEEE 14 bus test system and IEEE 30 bus test system are presented.",

If the requirements on the independence of redundant parts are unfulfilled, then a common-cause failure can directly cause a hazardous state on a system level through its effects on multiple redundant parts. Identification of sources and quantification of the common-cause failure parameters has been proved to be a formidable task. The latter problem, including other major safety-affecting factors lays in the focus of this paper. Our proposed technical safety analysis concept is extended, so now it partially covers elusive problems related to the common-cause failures.",

Rank Based Fingerprinting (RBF) will be described in detail together with Nearest Neighbour fingerprinting algorithms. RBF algorithm is a new algorithm and was designed as improvement of standard fingerprinting algorithms. Therefore exhaustive testing needs to be performed. This testing is mainly focused on optimal distribution of APs and its impact on positioning accuracy. Simulations were performed in Matlab environment in three different scenarios. In the first scenario different numbers of APs were implemented in the area to estimate the impact of APs number on the localization accuracy of the Rank Based Fingerprinting algorithm. The second scenario was introduced to evaluate the impact of APs placement in the localization area on the accuracy of the positioning using fingerprinting algorithms. The last scenario was proposed to investigate an impact of the number of heard APs and distribution of the RSS values on the accuracy of the RBF algorithm. Results achieved by the RBF algorithm in the first and second scenarios were compared to commonly used NN and WKNN algorithms.",

		"Abstract": "In symbolic sensitivity analysis very important role plays the number of additionally generated expressions and in consequence additional number of arithmetical operations. The main drawback of some methods based on the adjoint graph or on the two-graph technique, i.e. the necessity to multiply analyze the corresponding graph, is avoided. Advantages of the method suggested are that, the matrix inversion is not required and the Coates graph is significantly simplified.  Simplifications of the method introduced in this paper lead to the significant reduction of the final symbolic expressions without violation of accuracy. This simplification method can be considered as SBG-type and has an important  impact on symbolic analysis. A special software tool called \"HoneySen\" has been developed to implement the suggested method. In the paper, it was shown that the presented method is more effective than the transimpedance method taking the number of arithmetical operations and the circuit insight into consideration. Comparison results for the multiparameter sensitivity calculations of the voltage the transfer function for a fourth-order low pass filter and a second-order  high-pass filter are presented.",

		"Abstract": "The external magnetic field in transformer oil-based magnetic fluids leads to the aggregation of magnetic nanoparticles and formation of  clusters. These aggregations are the result of the interaction between the external magnetic field and the magnetic moments of the nanoparticles occurs. However, the temperature of magnetic fluids has also very important influence on the structural changes because the mechanism of thermal motion acts against the cluster creation.  The acoustic spectroscopy was used to study the anisotropy of transformer oil-based magnetic fluids upon the effect of an external magnetic field and temperature. In present the anisotropy of the magnetic fluids can be described by two theories.  Taketomi theory assumes the existence of spherical clusters. These clusters form long chains, aligned in a magnetic field direction. Shliomis in his theory supposed that only nanoparticles formed chains. A comparison of the experimental results with the predictions of the Taketomi theory allowed a determination of the cluster radius and the number density of the colloidal particles. The proportions of the acoustic wave energy used for excitation of the translational and rotational motion were determined.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, a Dynamic Economic/Emission Dispatch (DEED) problem is obtained by considering both the economy and emission objectives with required constraints dynamically. This paper presents an optimization algorithm for solving constrained combined economic emission dispatch (EED) problem and DEED, through the application of neural network, which is a flexible Hopfield neural network (FHNN). The constrained DEED must not only satisfy the system load demand and the spinning reserve capacity, but some practical operation constraints of generators, such as ramp rate limits and prohibited operating zone, are also considered in practical generator operation. The feasibility of the proposed FHNN using to solve DEED is demonstrated using three power systems, and it is compared with the other methods in terms of solution quality and computation efficiency. The simulation results showed that the proposed FHNN method was indeed capable of obtaining higher quality solutions efficiently in constrained DEED and EED problems with a much shorter computation time compared to other methods.",

		"Abstract": "The deployment of passive optical networks (PONs) is slow today, especially in Europe, because completely new optical infrastructures are necessary to be installed in the last-mile segments of access networks, which is always very expensive process. One of the possibilities is to design economically effective topologies and to optimize the deployment cost. This article describes the method leading to evaluate an algorithm for designing suboptimal economic solutions and topologies for PONs by focusing on optimization of constructional length of distribution networks. While the typical PON topologies are star topologies or tree-star topologies, the first part of this article introduces new sub algorithm for estimating the minimum star topology. The next section brings the evaluation of two sub algorithms for solving minimum constructional length problems. Finally, all these parts will be merged into a complex algorithm by using clusterization technique to solve optimum topologies. However, the current version of presented algorithm is purely based on mathematical theories and was implemented in Matlab environment. Therefore, it is able to design only theoretical optimum topologies without taking external conditions and real limitations into account. These real conditions will be further implemented in the future, so the algorithm could be also used for practical applications.",

It can be important a mechanism for switching between these modalities, in order to exploit in a better way the satellite resources. In this paper a proposal of a novel switching mechanism is presented. Simulation campaigns are carried out in order to validate the proposal algorithm considering different user application distributions.

		"Abstract": "Despite integration of advanced functions that enable Femto Access Points (FAPs) to be deployed in a plug-and-play manner, the femtocell concept still cause several opened issues to be resolved. One of them represents an assignment of Physical Cell Identifiers (PCIs) to FAPs. This paper analyses a random based assignment algorithm in LTE systems operating in diverse femtocell scenarios. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by comparing the number of confusions for various femtocell densities, PCI ranges and knowledge of vicinity. Simulation results show that better knowledge of vicinity can significantly reduce the number of confusions events.",

In this paper, a new prediction algorithm is proposed, for the pre-reservation of passive bandwidth, when mobile users moves under radio coverage that can be considered as a cellular one (GSM, UMTS, WLAN clusters, etc.). The Hidden Markov Chains (HMC) theory is used to design the predictor, as the main component of the proposed idea, that does not depend on the considered transmission technology, mobility model or vehicular scenario. Mobile ReSerVation Protocol (MRSVP) has been used in order to realize the active/passive bandwidth reservation in the considered network topology.

It deals with the improvement of the received signal arrival time determination in the case of NLoS communication with undetected direct path.

		"Abstract": "In real time video streaming, the frames must meet their timing constraints, typically specified as their deadlines. Wireless networks may suffer from bandwidth limitations. To reduce the data transmission over the wireless networks, we propose an adaption technique in the server side by extracting a part of the video frames that considered as a Region Of Interest (ROI), and drop the part outside the ROI from the frames that are between reference frames. The estimated position of the selection of the ROI is computed by using the Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) between consecutive frames. The reconstruction mechanism to the region outside the ROI is implemented in the mobile side by using linear interpolation between reference frames. We evaluate the proposed approach by using Mean Opinion Score (MOS) measurements. MOS are used to evaluate two scenarios with equivalent encoding size, where the users observe the first scenario with low bit rate for the original videos, while for the second scenario the users observe our proposed approach with high bit rate. The results show that our technique significantly reduces the amounts of data are streamed over wireless networks, while the reconstruction mechanism will provides acceptable video quality.",

The cons, as shown in our previous work, are the inability of E-model to reflect effects of network jitter present on real traffic flows and jitter-buffer behavior on end user devices. These effects are visible mostly on traffic over WAN, internet and radio networks and cause the E-model MOS call quality estimate to be noticeably too optimistic. In this paper, we propose a modification to E-model using previously proposed Pplef (effective packet loss) using jitter and jitter-buffer model based on Pareto/D/1/K system. We subsequently perform optimization of newly added parameters reflecting jitter effects into E-model by using PESQ intrusive measurement method as a reference for selected audio codecs. Function fitting and parameter optimization is performed under varying delay, packet loss, jitter and different jitter-buffer sizes for both, correlated and uncorrelated long-tailed network traffic.",

		"Abstract": "This article deals with both theoretical and practical application of Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol instead of different solution described detailed in the article. It uses periodically HTTP method POST to gain information about a state, which a client stands in. During this process a new connection is created and closed, what enormously makes network traffic mote intensive. Instead of this we used XMPP, this technology eliminates disadvantages of synchronous HTTP connection by its adapting for real time connection. It uses stable connection, what does not need to create it any time any information needs to be sent. It decreased amount of transported data through a network and a time, in which is a client informed about an event due to a fact, that the new solution works in real time.",

For this purpose, we have defined XML format for delivery of phone numbers which are located in the target area and these numbers are obtained from mobile BTS's (Base transmission stations). The advantage of this aproach lies in controlled delivery and finally the list of unanswered calls is exported and these users are informed via SMS.

		"Abstract": "The inflection of the Slovak language causes a large number of unique word forms, which produces not only a large vocabulary, but also a number of out-of-vocabulary words. Morph-based language models solve this problem by decomposition of inflected word forms into small sub-word units and resolve the general problem of sparsity the training data. In this paper, we present several rule-based and data-driven approaches to the automatic segmentation of words into morphs. These data are later used in the modeling of the Slovak language for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition.

The proposed topology is able to compensate balanced sags/swells as well as unbalanced ones. Moreover it can compensate harmonic pollution of the input source. The simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink environment show that the proposed DVR operates well during different disturbances and it has the ability to control the sensitive load voltage.",

		"Abstract": "The human postural control system represents a biological feedback system responsible for maintenance of upright stance. Vestibular, proprioceptive and visual sensory inputs provide the most important information into the control system, which controls body centre of mass (COM) in order to stabilize the human body resembling an inverted pendulum. The COM can be measured indirectly by means of a force plate as the centre of pressure (COP). Clinically used measurement method is referred to as posturography. In this paper, the conventional static posturography is extended by visual stimulation, which provides insight into a role of visual information in balance control. Visual stimuli have been designed to induce body sway in four specific directions \u2013 forward, backward, left and right. Stabilograms were measured using proposed single-PC based system and processed to calculate velocity waveforms and posturographic parameters. The parameters extracted from pre-stimulus and on-stimulus periods exhibit statistically significant differences.",

		"Abstract": "The Optical fiber DTS (Distribution Temperature Systems) are unique distributed temperature systems using optical fiber\u00a0as a\u00a0sensor. These systems are able to measure the temperature along the fiber, in some case they can measure tension as well. For their\u00a0function they use nonlinear effect in optical fiber (Raman nonlinear effect, Brillouin nonlinear effect). The greatest advantage of this sensor system is just using of the optical fiber (electromagnetic resistance, small size, safety using in inflammable and explosive area, easy installation, etc.). The Optical fiber DTS systems can be used with advantage even in areas, where the using of classic sensors would be problematic. The typical example is monitoring of outflows in pipelines, illegal service connection etc. In some processes it is necessary to know exact temperature (tension) in particular points. There it can appear a problem with resolution of the optical-fiber DTS. This article deals with problems of the optical meanders implementation into the\u00a0building processes.",

		"Abstract": "In this paper, we present a method for solving the power flow problem by the method of DC power flow using the graphical programming environment of LabVIEW as a virtual instrument (VI) suitable for contingency analysis. The DC power flow greatly simplifies the power flow by making a number of approximations including 1) completely ignoring the reactive power balance equations, 2) assuming all voltage magnitudes are identically one per unit, 3) ignoring line losses and 4) ignoring tap dependence in the transformer reactance. Hence the DC power flow reduces the power flow problem to a set of linear equations. The effectiveness of the method developed is identified through its application to a 6 buses test system. The calculation results show excellent performance of the proposed method, in regard to computation time and quality of results.",

It is known that better monitoring and process control of casting improves the steel quality and is able to ensure customers\u2019 requirements in terms of sizes, brands, quantities and properties with lower costs. The crystallizer belongs among the most important parts of this whole process [1]. At present many methods for analysing of the crystallizer temperature profile in operation were published and experimentally verified. In these methods, the thermocouples or Bragg gratings are widely used. New sophisticated analysis method of crystallizer temperature profile is the utilization of the optical fiber DTS based on the stimulated Raman scattering.

This complexity also involves an important amount of information. Therefore, the research of polarization states of scattered light is one of emerging novel techniques in biomedical science.

A sensitive CCD camera has been used for mapping of surface photon emission. The operation point of the samples has been set to reverse bias mode, and different electric field intensity was applied. We managed to get interesting information using a combination of optical investigation and electrical noise measurement in time and spectral domain. It will be revealed that a direct correlation between noise and photon emission exists and the results related to several defect spots are presented in detail in this paper.",

		"Abstract": "The designing of PID controllers is a frequently discussed problem. Many of design methods have been developed, classic (analytical tuning methods, optimization methods etc.) or not so common fuzzy knowledge based methods which are designed to achieve good setpoint following, corresponding time response etc. In this case, the new way of designing PID controller parameters is created where the above mentioned knowledge system based on relations of Ziegler-Nichols design methods is used, more precisely the combination of the both Ziegler-Nichols methods. The proof of efficiency of a proposed method and a numerical experiment is presented.",

This article briefly describes the tool Kaira intended for modelling, simulation and generation of parallel applications. A developer is able to model parallel programs and different aspects of communication using Kaira. Models are based on the variant of Coloured Petri Nets. The important feature of our tool automatic is generation of standalone parallel applications from models. The final application can be generated with different parallel back-ends, currently it can be threads or MPI.",

Then, certain de-noising methods are described together with possible improvements. On their basis, an improvement of Kuan method (KuanS) is proposed. Performance of proposed KuanS method is tested on real ultrasound images and synthetic images corrupted with speckle noise. PSNR, edge preservation, standard deviation of homogenous regions and SIR are used for the evaluation of quality of noise suppression. Performance of the KuanS is compared with other methods. The KuanS method achieves satisfactory results even in comparison with more complex methods (SRAD, wavelet based noise suppression).",

For this reason, we introduce an alternative method for automated retrieval of region of interest. In the first step, the metallographic image is segmented using both spectral method and thresholding. Then, the extracted macrostructure of the metallographic image is automatically analyzed by statistical methods. Finally, automatically extracted region of interests are compared with results of human experts.\u00a0 Practical experience with retrieval of non-homogeneous noised digital images in industrial environment is discussed as well.",

The system tests the SIP element for several usually occurring attacks and it compiles evaluation of its overall security on the basis of successfully or unsuccessfully penetrations. The article describes the applications and algorithms that are used by system and the conclusion consists recommendations and guidelines to ensure effective protection against VoIP PBX threats.

In this paper, a method of jitter effect is proposed. Jitter as voice packet time uncertainty appears as increased packet loss caused by jitter memory buffer under- or overflow. Jitter buffer behaviour at receiver\u2019s side is modelled as Pareto/D/1/K system with Pareto-distributed packet interarrival times and its performance is experimentally evaluated by using statistic tools. Jitter buffer stochastic model is then incorporated into E-model in an additive manner accounting for network jitter effects via excess packet loss complementing measured network packet loss. Proposed modification of E-model input parameter adds two degrees of freedom in modelling: network jitter and jitter buffer size.",

		"Abstract": "Modern telecommunication networks work on the transmission method of common data streams in which data bursts consisting of packets that further consist of particular bits are multiplexed from various traffic sources. The larger amount of data is transmitted through a transmission medium (optical fibre), the more frequently bursts occur, and the lower amount of data, the more rarely they follow. If it is required to monitor how large amount of data is being transmitted in a network branch in order to find out, to which measure this branch is occupied, it is not necessary to take each information unit (each packet or even each particular bit). It will do if information whether a data burst occurs in the transmission or does it not occur is taken in certain time intervals \u2013 with a certain sampling frequency.

The transmission parameters of homogenous metallic line can be easily described by telegraph equations or cascade matrix; there are also several models for NEXT and FEXT frequency dependence. But these models and equations could not be applied in the situation of two or more different cascaded transmission lines, because these cascaded lines do not meet the essential condition of overall homogenous transmission line. However in such case, it is still possible to estimate the overall transmission characteristics of the whole combination thanks to the characteristics of each separate element. This paper brings the description of complex measurements performed for the combination of three different metallic cables and based on these measurements, several conclusions about the possibilities of modelling the attenuation and NEXT and FEXT crosstalk for cascaded transmission lines are presented.",

		"Abstract": "Paralleling of converter modules is a well-known technique that is often used in medium-power applications to achieve the desired output power by using smaller size of high frequency transformers and inductors. In this paper, a parallel-connected single-phase PFC topology using flyback and forward converters is proposed to improve the output voltage regulation with simultaneous input power factor correction (PFC) and control. The goal of the control is to stabilize the output voltage of the converter against the load variations. The paper presents the derivation of fuzzy control rules for the dc/dc converter circuit and control algorithm for regulating the dc/dc converter. This paper presents a design example and circuit analysis for 200 W power supply. The proposed approach offers cost effective, compact and efficient AC/DC converter by the use of parallel power processing. MATLAB/SIMULINK is used for implementation and simulation results show the performance improvement.",

		"Abstract": "The control of Inverted Pendulum (IP) is a hugely complex task. A great deal of nonlinearity  is present inherently and as well as affected by the surrounding external conditions. The sliding mode controller (SMC) is very robust inherently. It is used in this paper to control the IP. This  paper examines the designing of  sliding mode controller (SMC) for a linear  inverted pendulum (IP). The paper highlights the important features  of the sliding mode and also throws ample lights on the designing guidelines. The paper puts special impetus on the mathematical modeling of the controller. The robustness of the design of SMC with proportional control is amply displayed with the help of simple mathematics. It gives rise to a controller which can control a highly nonlinear system like IP quite efficiently. The performance of the SMC  is compared with fuzzy and PID controller. The  edge  this controller poses is the key aspect of this paper. External disturbances and internal inaccuracies  are also introduced to the system to bring out the robustness of the controller to the fore. Background on sliding mode and the pendulum  are provided. Simulation results are displayed in a vivid manner and explained suitably.",

This becomes necessary, because a\u00a0major fault like loss of an actuator breaks the corresponding control loop and therefore renders the whole system inoperable.\u00a0 An important aim of control reconfiguration is to change the control structure as little as possible, since every change bears the potential of practical problems. The proposed solution is to keep the original controller in the loop and to add an extension called virtual actuator that implements the necessary changes of the control structure. The virtual actuator translates between the signals of the nominal controller and the signal of the faulty plants.

		"Abstract": "The impact of automation is visible in all areas of industry as well as in everyday life. Automation makes the process control more efficient, increases productivity of work, manufacturing quality, decreases manufacturing costs. Automation is still in development so that it could succeed in filling all requirements of today\u2019s technical advance. For this reason we daily meet new questions about implementation of automation systems, their handling and expanding. One of these is the question of communication in industrial applications. In case of having more PLCs in one industrial network, it is necessary to solve their inter-communication. We should deal with this question in dependence on some facts, for example: used control system, used industrial network, transmission reliability requirements and so on. In this article we would like to present a solution for inter-communication between PLCs in one industrial network by S7 communication. S7 communication via Industrial Ethernet allows program-controlled communication using communication SFBs/FBs via configured S7 connections.",

		"Abstract": "Modern telecommunication networks work on the transmission method of common data streams in which data bursts consisting of packets that further consist of particular bits are multiplexed from various traffic sources. The larger amount of data is transmitted through a transmission medium (optical fibre), the more frequently bursts occur, and the lower amount of data, the more rarely they follow. If it is required to monitor how large amount of data is being transmitted in a network branch in order to find out, to which measure of this branch is occupied, it is not necessary to take each information unit (each packet or even each particular bit). It will do if information whether a data burst occurs in the transmission or does it not occur is taken in certain time intervals \u2013 with a certain sampling frequency. The paper deals with this sampling intervals.",

Current standard modeling methods provide only rough estimations of FEXT characteristics based on average values of crosstalk for the whole cable. However, for practical implementation of vector discrete multi-tone modulation (VDMT) is necessary to predict and simulate FEXT characteristics with sufficient accuracy and simulate FEXT transfer functions individually for each combination of symmetrical pairs in a cable. This article contains a theoretical analysis and description of the problem and suggests a new method for modeling of FEXT crosstalk using capacitive and inductive unbalances between pairs in a cable. This proposed model offers more accurate and realistic results of crosstalk. Theoretical simulations and results are also compared with the measured characteristics for specific metallic cable.",

It is known that echo with long transmission delays becomes more noticeable to users. Thus, time delay estimation, as a part of echo cancellation, is an important topic during transmission of voice signals over packetswitching telecommunication systems. An echo delay problem associated with IP-based transport networks is discussed in the following text. The paper introduces the comparative study of time delay estimation algorithm, used for estimation of the true time delay between two speech signals. Experimental results of MATLab simulations that describe the performance of several methods based on cross-correlation, normalized crosscorrelation and generalized cross-correlation are also presented in the paper.",

		"Abstract": "Nowadays, there are several application in the field of position controlled electric drives, such as high speed cutting, where traditional cascade control structures provide insufficient accuracy. Therefore, it is necessary either to completely change the control structure (e.g. sliding mode control) or to modify and extend the basic cascade structure. One of those modifications can be feedforward direct branches. Feedforward increase order of astatism without stability influencing but on the other hand it brings other problems regarding to the feedforward technique implementation, system parameters changing or neglecting particular system behavior. This paper describes basic control structures, their features and several mentioned problems related to feedforward control of electric drives.",

Crosstalk depends mostly on the frequency. Frequency dependent transfer functions and crosstalk attenuation may be obtained by measurement, but for the analytical description of the transmission channel's parameters is useful to define functions modelling the crosstalk. The paper describes the measuring facility, presents the measured waveforms and the values of model parameters.",

These optical networks consist only of passive optical components, essential role play mainly the passive optical splitters.

The program for the purposes of rapid calculation of the passive optical network attenuation was designed. It supports various network topologies and it enables to enter initial parameters of optical network. The outputs in the tabular form also include the assessment of the suitability of proposed optical network for the different variants of passive optical networks.",

The task is to change the sampling rate from\u00a0fvz3=500Hz to fvz4=360Hz. There are two methods; in the text are called Method A and Method B. The Method B has two approximations, first and second order. The basic idea of Method A is to find the least common multiple. It has to use integrator (low-pass filter, cut frequency is half of original signal) and decimator (low-pass filter, cut frequency is half of final signal). At first the zero samples are pasted, these are filtered by low-pass filter and then the computed samples are selected. The method B is not so exacting for computation, because the integrate factor is smaller, than in the method A. Of course, there are used integrate filters (low-pass filter). The first order approximation selects the nearer sample of both border samples. The second order approximation interpolates samples by line. Selected sample is therefore more accurate.",

		"Abstract": "This paper deals with VoIP communication security and various techniques of VoIP attacks. We divided these threats in several categories according to their specific behaviour and their impact on the affected system. We also tried to find effective methods to prevent or mitigate these attacks. We focused our work on Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) as a real threat for the future. We have developed both a tool generating SPIT attacks and AntiSPIT tool defending communication systems against SPIT attacks. AntiSPIT represents an effective protection based on statistical blacklist and works without participation of the called party which is a significant advantage.",

		"Abstract": "Delay in VoIP technology is very unpleasant issue and therefore a voice packets prioritization must be ensured. To maintain the high call quality a maximum information delivery time from the sender to the recipient is set to 150 ms. This paper focuses on the design of a mathematical model of end-to-end delay of a VoIP connection, in particular on a delay variation. It describes all partial delay components and mechanisms, their generation, facilities and mathematical formulations. A new approach to the delay variation model is presented and its validation has been done by experimention.",

		"Abstract": "Holmium thin films were prepared by evaporation in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and high precision electrical resistance measurements were performed on them as well as on holomium bulk sample in the wide temperature range from 4,2 K up to the room temperature. Electric charge transport is profoundly influenced by the magnetic structure at low temperatures and a \"knee-like\" resistance anomaly was observed near the transportation from paramagnetic state to basal-plane spiral structure in bulk with the Neel temperature TN=128,9 K and below ~ 122 K in thin Ho films in a thickness range from 98 nm to 215 nm. Unexpected resistance minimum at ~ 9 K and a slope\u00b4s charge of the R vs. T curve near ~ 170 K was observed in 215 nm thin film. Application of magnetic field parallel to the substrate and thin film plane for temperatures below ~ 150 K caused the decrease of resistence value with increasing magnetic flux density. Increasing suppression of the TN value up to ~ 5 K with increasing flux density value up to 5 T was observed in Ho films.\u00a0",

		"Abstract": "Modern power electric drives brought advantages in induction motor control. In the same time appeared problems with high frequency square waveform voltage (pulse stress) produced by the voltage converters. Voltage converters produce repetitive pulses with high level of voltage rise fronts (slew rates). Rise fronts attained values of up to tens kilovolts per microsecond and voltage pulse repetition frequency up to some tens of kilohertz. This technology is an advantage for a drive control. Significant is the impact of these voltage waveforms on the motor insulations. Degradation of the main wall insulation can reduce the reliability of the electric motor and whole drive. In this paper is discussed one possible solution. The promising modification in the insulation material structure is presented in the paper.",

Data can be used for system that automatically searches for a specific person in a sequence also for special video sequences. Audio/video properties are presented by descriptors and description schemes. There are many features that can be used to characterize multimedial signals. We can analyze audio and video sequences jointly or considered them completely separately. Our aim is oriented to possibilities of combining multimedial features.

		"Abstract": "In this paper we engage in optimalization of convenient beacons for localization position of a node in the ad-hoc network. An algorithm designed by us localizes position of moving or static node by RSS (Received Signal Strength) method and trilateration. At first, localization of unknown node runs by combination of all beacons. Than optimalizating algorithmreduces the number of beacons (and repeats localization), while only three left. Its reduction is based on highest levels of received signal strength. It is only when signals are from the nearest beacons. Position localizating exactness is statistically interpreted from all localization by beacons combination and its repeating.",

In this paper are discussedtwo methods to calculate the damper cage currents, one based on a coupled field-circuit approach when all the machine dimensions and winding should be known and another based on DC-decay tests conducted with the rotor on d, respectively q axis when all the transient parameters and time constants are obtained.

Development of C-LIM mathematical model is based on circuit method and analogy to rotary induction motor. The analogy between both: (a) stator and rotor windings of rotary induction motor and (b) winding of primary part of C-LIM (inductor) and closed current circuits in external secondary part of C-LIM (race) is taken into consideration. The equations of C-LIM mathematical model are presented as matrix together with equations expressing each vector separately. A computational analysis of selected transient states of C-LIM fed via frequency converter is presented in the paper. Two typical examples of C-LIM operation are considered for the analysis: (a) starting the motor at various static loads and various synchronous velocities and (b) reverse of the motor at the same operation conditions. Results of simulation are presented as transient responses including transient electromagnetic force, transient linear velocity and transient phase current.",

The passive optics location is suitable just for tracking of targets with mean velocity which is limited by the hardware basis. The aim of this work is to recognize plasma, particles etc. It is possible to propose such kind of evaluation methods which improve the capture probability markedly. Suggested method is dealing with the short-distance evaluation of targets. We suppose the application of three independent principles how to recognize an object in a scanned picture. These principles use similar stochastic functions in order to evaluate an object location by means of simple mathematical operations. Methods are based on direct evaluation of picture sequence by the help of the histogram and frequency spectrum. We find out the probability of unidentified moving object in pictures. If the probability reaches a setting value we will get a signal.",

		"Abstract": "The disconnectors belong to elements widely used in electrical power engineering and apparatus technology for disconnecting various electric circuits. Usually they work without voltage (the circuit is first switched off by a circuit breaker). Nevertheless, in a fault regime the contacts of the disconnector may carry the full voltage, which may result in the electric arc between them at the moment when the movable contact approaches to the fixed one. In order to estimate this moment it is necessary to know the time evolution of the electric field in the domain between both contacts. This problem is solved in 3D (in somewhat simplified geometry) by the integral technique. The theoretical analysis is supplemented with an illustrative example whose results are discussed.",

		"Abstract": "Calculation method proposed for powerful sources radiation evaluation. Taken attention that in calculations it is necessary to use average radiated power. For example in case of radars it depends on two facts: radar radiates short radio impulses with long pauses between them and rotated antenna with narrow pattern of directivity in horizontal plane radiates into chosen point a short part of antenna\u2019s rotation period. Calculation is made for Thomson radar according proposed equations. It is shown that antenna in 5 m height radiates power flux density into level of man head more times smaller than permitted level according Lithuanian normative - 20,0 uW/cm2.",

First, we determine the eddy currents induced in the tubular screen by the magnetic field of self-current of the phase conductor. Then the magnetic field in the external parallel phase conductor is presented by means of a vector magnetic potential as Fourrier series. In the non-conducting external and internal area of the screen we use Laplace equation for the magnetic field strength taking into account the reverse reaction of eddy currents induced in the screen. In the conducting screen we apply Helmholtz equation for eddy currents density. Using classical boundary conditions we determine the density of the currents. The solutions obtained are used to determine the total eddy currents induced in all the screens of the GIL under consideration.",

The proposed methods are expected to non-destructive test of materials. There are shown examples of the identification of voids or cracks in special structures called honeycombs. Instead of the experimental data we used the phantom evaluated voltage values based on the application of finite element method.

The presented calibration strategy reduces the time of preparing multi-channel flow detector for the test, allows the correction of spatial placement of the probes and allows to improve the repeatability of the measurements.

		"Abstract": "We investigated thin films of amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H) deposited by PECVD under increasingdilutions of silane plasma by hydrogen. We found out that under increasing additional hydrogen at the depositions, thin filmsobtain less hydrogen bonded to silicon. The optical band gap energies determined from UV Vis transmittance and reflectancespectra were found to be increasing function of the dilution. We deduce that optical band gaps expanse due to the decreasingdimensions of silicon nanocrystals. They were calculated to be of 2 \u2013 4 nm which proves the medium-range order in a-Si:H.",

		"Abstract": "Acquisition of basic characteristic of defects has become possible through a wide class of measurement techniqueswhich probe the interface, the near interface, as well as the bulk of semiconductor. Results presented here are basedessentially on the acoustic version of Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (A-DLTS) measurements. This method is based onthe acoustoelectric response effect observed at the interface. The A-DLTS uses the acoustoelectric response signal (ARS)produced by MOS structure interface when a longitudal acoustic wave propagates through a structure. The ARS is extremelysensitive to external conditions of the structure and reflects any changes in the charge distribution connected with chargedtraps. The temperature dependence of ARS after bias voltage step application is investigated and the activation energies andsome other parameters of traps at the insulator \u2013 semiconductor interface are determined. The results obtained formArrhenius plots of A-DLTS spectra of selected MOS structures are compared with results obtained from modeling of ADLTS spectra using theoretical model.",

Within this filler concentrationthe permeability of composites changed continuously with the change of ferrite filler content ratio between two types offerrite fillers. The observed relaxation type of permeability dispersion was due to the domain wall and natural ferromagneticresonance phenomena and was also attributed to the high damping of spin motion. Measured values of permeability wereused to determine the EM-wave absorption properties (return loss RL, matching frequency fm, matching thickness dm andbandwidth Df for RL \u00a3 -20 dB). The calculation of these properties was based on a model of single-layered absorber backedby a perfect conductor using transmission-line and EM-field theory. The composite with the volume fraction ratio of hybridMnZn:LiZn ferrite filler set to 0.5:0.5 has shown a return loss of -57 dB (> 99 % power absorption) at fm = 714 MHz with the-20 dB bandwidth of Df = 232 MHz for an absorber thickness of 7.79 mm.",

Statistical analysis of the results gathered during automatic ultrasonic tests gives data which lead, together with use of features of measuring method, differential lossy coding and traditional method of lossless data compression (Huffman\u2019s coding, dictionary coding), to a comprehensive, efficient data compression algorithm. The subject of the article is to present the algorithm and the benefits got by using it in comparison to alternative compression methods. Storage of large amount\u00a0 of data allows to create an electronic catalogue of ultrasonic defects.

		"Abstract": "The performance of a radar receiver is greatly dependent on the presence of noise. The receiver should achieve the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) and the maximum probability of the target detection. The CFAR receivers are usually used in radar applications for the radar signal processing in case of unknown or time-varying background noise statistics, especially in cases when clutter or jamming signals are above the receiver threshold. CFAR automatically adjusts the threshold to prevent the threshold crossings. The paper deals with a software-based implementation of CFAR. The softwarebased CFAR processing was tested on various types of processors and processing times were compared. The best resultswere achieved using the dual-core AMD Athlon64 X2 4800+ using SSE2 instructions for processing.",

Considering the SIR requirements, each transmitter in the WCDMA network have to use minimum output power, which is necessary to span channel fading. Accurate transmitter power level can be achieved by using optional power control loops, which send appropriate Transmitter Power Control (TPC) commands through dedicated feedback channel. Effect of power control commands delay in the WCDMA mobile radio network are presented by uplink simulations results. Presented power control loop is based on the standardized algorithm. The investigation of the influence of TPC commands delay in the case of high speed mobile subscriber helps in designing the optional link adaptation algorithm.",

		"Abstract": "The development of packed based multimedia networks reached a turning point when the ITU-T and the ETSIhave incorporated the IMS to the NGN. With the fast development of mobile communication more and more services andcontent are available. In contrast with fix network telephony both the services and the devices are personalized in the \u201cmobileworld\u201d. Services, known from the Internet - like e-mail, chat, browsing, presence, etc. \u2013 are already available via mobiledevices as well. The IMS originally wanted to exploit both the benefits of mobile networks and the fancy services of theInternet. But today it is already more than that. IMS is the core of the next generation telecommunication networks and abasis for fix-mobile convergent services. The fact however that IMS was originally a \u201cmobile\u201d standard, where IPv6 was notoddity generated some problems for the fix networks, where IPv4 is used. In this article I give an overview of these problemsand mention some solutions as well.",

The main advantage of this topology is the possibility of dividing the input voltage between the half-bridges.

It is necessary to avoid it by the control algorithm, which is described in the text. The practical results show a zero voltage switching technique and the limits of the chosen topology and of the control.",

The term \u201cshortcomings\u201d means that the pq theory does not provide a proper description of power properties. Moreover the control algorithm based on this theory only achieves satisfactory results for sinusoidal balanced voltage system.

		"Abstract": "The flux linkage of switched reluctance motor (SRM) depends on the stator current and position between the rotor and stator poles. The fact determines that during control of SRM current with the help of classical PI controllers in a wide regulation range unsatisfied results occur. The main reasons of the mentioned situation are big changes of the stator inductance depending on the stator current and rotor position. In a switched reluctance motor the stator phase inductance is a non-linear function of the stator phase current and rotor position. Fuzzy controller and fuzzy logic are generally non-linear systems; hence they can provide better performance in this case. Fuzzy controller is mostly presented as a direct fuzzy controller or as a system, which realizes continued changing parameters of other controller, so-called fuzzy supervisor. Referring to the usage of fuzzy logic as a supervisor of conventional PI controller in control of SRM possible improvement occurs.",

		"Abstract": "This paper presents the experimental evaluation of a commonly used methodology to tune the PI regulators of the Field Oriented Control (FOC) strategy for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs). The methodology used is based on the Absolute Value Optimum (AVO) and Symmetric Optimum (SO) criterions. These methods employ a simplified model of the plant to be controlled. Due to the complexity and non-linearities present in the FOC PMSM drive some divergence between the ideal response and the real results will occur. In this paper a comparison between simulated and experimental results is carried out to evaluate the goodness of the solution obtained. The divergences observed between simulations and the results obtained in the experimental setup are shown and it is attempted to justify the causes of them. Overall it is concluded that the method provides a satisfactory initial commissioning of the PI regulators for the drive system under study.",

		"Abstract": "At present a non-destructive testing of conducting materials becomes very important one in connection with monitoring and control of strategic technical facilities, e.g. nuclear power plants. There are more methods of material testing and evaluation and every of them has its advantages and disadvantages. Recently the electromagnetic methods are in increasing interest. There are many ways of conducting material testing. One of them often used utilises investigation of eddy currents induced in the surface layer by means of a proper coil. The arrangement is very simple and inexpensive but it offers only local information on cracks and other inhomogeneities in the thin surface layer. On the other hand there exist a method based on an electromagnetic \u2013 acoustic transducer (EMAT), which is able to generate and detect acoustic wave in a conducting body in a contact-less way. The present paper deals with a survey of EMATs for investigation of thin metalliclayers by means of Lamb waves. The new design of generation coil is presented.",

		"Abstract": "There are some suitable methods for ultra-short solitary electromagnetic pulses (EMP) measurement. The EMPs are generated by high power microwave generators. The characteristic of EMPs is high power level (Pmax = 250 MW) and very short time duration (tp \u00ce <1, 60> ns). Special requirements for measurement methods are placed because of the specific EMPs properties.Two suitable methods for this application are presented in the paper. The first \u2013 calorimetric method, utilizes the thermal impacts of microwave absorption. The second method presented \u2013 magneto-optic method, use the Faraday\u2019s magneto-optic effect as a sensor principle. It was realized combined calorimetric sensor and there were made some experimental EMP measurements with good results. The sensor utilizing magneto-optic method is in development.",

It is known from our own experiences that not all failures assigned to bearing currents were their real reason and we also know how hardly the mentioned currents can be measured on real machines and how work-intensive and expensive is to detect real reason of the failure on damaged bearing. We will not concern with basics of classical bearing currents in this paper, because they were known and studied in the beginning of the last century but our own investigations will be presented.",

Four coaxial rectangular tangential coils are used to induce eddy currents in a tested conductive object. The exciting coils are driven independently by phase-shifted AC currents; a ratio of amplitudes of the exciting currents is continuously changed to vary the distribution of eddy current density along material depth under a circular pick-up coil positioned in centre between the exciting coils. Dependences of a crack signal amplitude and its phase on the ratio are evaluated and special features are extracted. It is revealed that the dependences are strongly influenced by depth of a crack, and thus the extracted features can enhance evaluation of a detected crack.",

To prevent failure states of transformers, we perform different types ofmeasurements. They shall illustrate a momentary state of the measured equipment and if necessary to draw attention in advance to changes of parameters, which have specific relationship to no-failure operation of the equipment. The conditions under which breakdown of composite liquid/ solid insulation can occur, e.g. in transformer, play an important role in designing such insulation. The liquid, mainly mineral oil, generally constitutes the weakest part of insulation and a great amount of work has been devoted to the study of streamers, which appear in the gaseous phase, and most often are triggering the failure of insulation.",

		"Abstract": "Lithuania introduced normative of public protection from 50 Hz frequency electric field. It proposed permissible intensity of this field \u2013 0,5 kV/m inside buildings and 1 kV/m in their territory. Separate normative is prepared for industry frequency electric and magnetic fields in work places. Permitted values of fields depend on exposure duration, but cannot exceed 25 kV/m and 5,1 kA/m. Russian, Swedish and American scientists declare that long time exposure of 50 Hz magnetic field with intensity more than 0,2-0,3 \u00b5T is dangerous for carcinogenic risk. International Agency for research on Cancer (IARC) initiated a program to evaluate the carcinogenic risk of low frequency electromagnetic fields to humans and till 2002 year collected a lot of information for different countries with quantitative analysis of epidemic data. Standardized incidents ratio (SIR) was proposed for evaluation of leukaemia in humans and especially children. Exposure of children in magneticfields > 0,4 \u00b5T showed a twofold SIR increasing. Data concerning the subject of an evaluation did not disclose inadequate evidence in humans and experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of magnetic fields of industry frequency, but they are classified as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans\u201d.",

Augmented reality has the ability to change a person\u2019s sensory experience. More applications of this technology are gradually being utilised for therapeutic purposes as augmented environments can be used both to distract the attention of patients from excruciatingly painful experiences and to promote cortical re-mapping at the site from where the pain arises.

The substitutions were performed to reduce the grain sizeand high magnetic uniaxial anisotropy field of the M-type Ba ferrite without affecting the magnetic polarisation. The goal isto reach the properties of ferrite proper for high-density magnetic recording and microwave absorption devices. Magneticproperties were determined as a function of the substitution level x. The specific saturation magnetic polarisation Js\u2013m andremanence Js\u2013rincreased with small x due to the substitution of non-magnetic and less magnetic ions in 4f1and 4f2sites. Thesteep decrease of coercivity Hc with increasing x may be caused by the Co2+preference of 4f2site and Ti4+or Zr4+ions preference of 2b and slightly in 4f1sites.

		"Abstract": "In this paper the numeric modelling of total resistance of a thin sheet, with local conductivity in randomlydistributed grains higher then is that of the basic matrix, is presented. The 2D model is formed by a structure of longitudinaland transversal conductors interconnected in nodes of a square net. In all nodes, using iteration procedure, the potential isdetermined from which the conductance of sheet is computed between two touching electrodes. The described model can beused to imitate the behaviour of heterogeneous thin conducting sheets prepared by different techniques. The model wasverified in some cases where the net resistance is well known from the theory.",

		"Abstract": "IR measurements were carried out on both amorphous and polycrystalline silicon samples deposited by PECVDon glass substrate. The transition from amorphous to polycrystalline phase was achieved by increasing dilution of silaneplasma at the deposition process. The samples were found to be mixed phase materials. Commonly, infrared spectra ofhydrogenated silicon thin films yield information about microstructure, hydrogen content and hydrogen bonding to silicon. Inthis paper, additional understanding was retrieved from infrared response. Applying standard optical laws, effective mediatheory and Clausius-Mossoti approach concerning the Si-Si and Si-H bonds under IR irradiation as individual oscillators,refractive indices in the long wavelength limit, crystalline, amorphous and voids volume fractions and the mass density of thefilms were determined. The mass density was found to decrease with increasing crystalline volume fraction, which can beattributed to the void-dominated mechanism of network formation.",

		"Abstract": "It is increasingly clear that the traditional way of measuring blood pressure in the clinic or office frequently produces numbers that grossly overestimate a patient\u2019s true blood pressure level. This effect is often caused by so called \u201ewhite coat\u201c syndrome. Nowadays, for this reason it becomes more popular so called home monitoring of blood pressure, that attenuates this effect. In the paper, there is described specially telemedicine system for monitoring of blood pressure. The system consists of blood monitor equipment which automatically reports results of up-to-date patient\u2019s measurements to the doctor\u2019s monitoring and decision support (MDS) system using wireless communication. The MDS system can make an evaluation for the doctor who can immediately intervene if necessary.

		"Abstract": "All astronauts often feel uncomfortable during first encounter microgravity because of fluid shifts from the lower extremities to the head caused by weightlessness. Parabolic flights offer a great possibility for research of this phenomenon under \u201czero gravity\u201d. With a combination of the optoelectronic sensor concepts PPG and PPGI and an ultrasound device it should be possible to measure all relevant parameters for description and further explanation of rapid fluid shifts along the body axis in humans during parabolic flights. A research team of the RWTH Aachen University and the Charit\u00e9 University Berlin will participate in the 7th German Parabolic Flight Campaign in September 2005 and perform the experiments under micro gravitation. A combination of used non-invasive strategies will reveal new insights into the human hemodynamics under microgravity conditions. The optoelectronic part of this interdisciplinary research experiment, details from the measuring setup, data collecting and post processing will be discussed.",

		"Abstract": "The phenomena of rhythm fluctuation of arterial blood pressure were discovered already in the first continuous recordings in the 18th century. However the formation of such rhythms hasn\u2019t been explained until now. This work presents two concepts which could aid in bringing new insights into the understanding of these rhythms. One development is a multisensor system capable to acquire multiple PPG channels, ECG and additionally breathing signals to correlate local and central driven oscillations. The second new development is Photoplethysmography Imaging which allows contactless measurements of cutaneous perfusion with spatial resolution. Together with the necessary mathematical analysis tools like\u00a0the Wavelet Transform a sound basis for assessment and evaluation of rhythm fluctuations in human hemodynamics is provided. Using the presented framework new, previously unreported phenomena of distributed blood volume movements in dermal perfusion could be observed.",

		"Abstract": "Our work at Ireland\u2019s National Rehabilitation Hospital involves designing communication systems for people suffering from profound physical disabilities. One such system uses the electro-oculogram, which is an (x,y) system of voltages picked up by pairs of electrodes placed, respectively, above and below and on either side of the eyes. The eyeball has a dc polarisation between cornea and back, arising from the photoreceptor rods and cones in the retina. As the eye rotates, the varying voltages projected onto the electrodes drive a cursor over a mimic keyboard on a computer screen. Symbols are selected with a switching action derived, for example, from a blink. Experience in using this mode of communication has given us limited facilities to study the eye position control system. We present here a resulting new feedback model for rotation in either the vertical or the horizontal plane, which involves the eyeball controlled by an agonist-antagonist muscle pair, modelled by a single equivalent bidirectional muscle with torque falling off linearly with angular velocity. We have incorporated muscle spindles and have tuned them by pole assignment associated with an optimum stability criterion.",

		"Abstract": "A method for noninvasive identification of heart lesions with changed repolarization caused by local ischemia was proposed and tested on a model and on a group of patients. It evaluates changes in QRST integral maps measured on a chest surface of known geometry and computes an equivalent dipole representing the position, size and orientation of the lesion. Testing on a computer model indicated ability of the method to localize small\u00a0 subendocardial and subepicardial lesions with an error less about 1 cm. From 11 patients with single vessel stenosis mapped before and after the percutaneous cardiac intervention, differences in QRST integral maps could be represented by a dipole in 8 patients. 6 LAD and 1 RCA lesion were identified successfully, localization of 1 RCA lesion failed. Results of the study suggest that difference QRST integral maps can help in identification of small ischemic regions on the epicardial or endocardial surface by estimating parameters of an equivalent dipole characterizing the lesion",

Selected properties and atomic structure in as-quenched state are studied by TEM, AFM, XRD any by measurement of magnetoresistance characteristics. The influence of heat treatment on transport and magnetic properties is shown on temperature dependencies of electrical resistivity and magnetization. It was founf that while the increase of Co content leads to the increase of Curie temperature of as-quenched structure, transition to nanocrystalline state is not affected in a significant manner. The as-quenched state for alloy without Co was found to contain thin crystal-containing layer which, however, was observed, contary to general behavior, at the side of the ribbon exposed to higher quenching rates.",

Performance of unpassivated and SiO2 passivated AlGaN/GaN HFETs, as well as passivated SiO2/AlGaN/GaN MOSHFETs (metal-oxide-semicondutor HFETs) is compared. It is found that MOSHFETs exhibit better DC and RF properties than simple HFET counterparts. Deposited SiO2 yielded an increase of the sheet carrier density from 7.6x10^12 cm^-2 to 9.2x10^12 cm^-2 and subsequent increase of the static drain saturation current from 0.75 A/mm to 1.09 A/mm. Small-signal RF characterisation of MOSHFETs showed an extrinsic current gain cut-off frequency fT of 24 GHz and a maximum frequency of oscillation fmax of 40 GHz. These are fully comparable values with state-of-the-art AlGaN/GaN HFETs. Finna\u016f\u016fy, microwave power measurements confirmed excellent performance of MOSHFETs:the output power measured at 7 GHz is about two-times larger than that of simple unpassived HFET. Thus, a great potential in application of GaN-based MOSHFETs is documented.",

		"Abstract": "Polarisation and conduction processes in dielectric systems can be identified by the time domain or the frequency domain measurements. If the systems is a linear one, the results of the time domain measurements can be transformed into the frequency domain, and vice versa. Commonly, the time domain data of the absorption conductivity are transformed into the frequency domain data of the dielectric susceptibility. In practice, the relaxation are mainly evaluated by the frequency domain data. In the time domain, the absorption current measurement were prefered up to now. Recent methods are based on the recovery voltage measurements. In this paper a new method of the recovery data conversion from the time the frequency domain is proposed. The method is based on the analysis of the recovery voltage transient based on the Maxwell equation for the current density in a dielectric. Unlike the previous published solutions, the Laplace fransform was used to derive a formula suitable for practical purposes. the proposed procedure allows also calculating of the insulation resistance and separating the polarisation and conduction losses.",

		"Abstract": "Holmium thin films were prepared by evaporation in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and high precision electrical resistance measurements were performed on them as well as on holomium bulk sample in the wide temperature range from 4,2 K up to the room temperature. Electric charge transport is profoundly influenced by the magnetic structure at low temperatures and a \"knee-like\" resistance anomaly was observed near the transportation from paramagnetic state to basal-plane spiral structure in bulk with the Neel temperature TN=128,9 K and below ~ 122 K in thin Ho films in a thickness range from 98 nm to 215 nm. Unexpected resistance minimum at ~ 9 K and a slope\u00b4s charge of the R vs. T curve near ~ 170 K was observed in 215 nm thin film. Application of magnetic field parallel to the substrate and thin film plane for temperatures below ~ 150 K caused the decrease of resistence value with increasing magnetic flux density. Increasing suppression of the TN value up to ~ 5 K with increasing flux density value up to 5 T was observed in Ho films.",

		"Abstract": "Commonly used diffraction method of photorefractive effect investigation does not give the complete information about properties of photorectrative record. Thus, the legitimate assumption aries that such a way of investigation cannot register manifestation of the all-possible mechanisms contributing to formation of the record in photorefractive medium. therefore, the combining of various ways of registering the record is required. In order to do so, except the classical diffraction investigation of photorefractive effect we used also imaging of refractive index distribution in the record by means of interference as well as imaging the transmittance of the sample in the place of the record. This contribution also presents some results obtained by methods of photorefractive record registration mentioned above. As the photorefractive mediumwas used Fe:LiNbO3 crystals.",

		"Abstract": "Two types of archaeological artefacts from remains of Early Medieval Age furnaces excavated in Nitra are analysed. They are supposed to originate from slag of glass and iron production. Employing Mossbauer spectrometry, iron crystallographic sites are identified and compared. In all samples, Fe2+ and Fe3+ structural positions were revealed. Some of the archeological artefacts including those that were supposed to originate from glass production show a presence of metallic iron and/or magnetic oxides. Based on the results of Mossbauer effect measurements performed at room temperature as well as 77 K (liquid nitrogen temperature) analytical evidence is provided that the iron sites identified are not as those usually encountered in glasses. Consequently, a conclusion is proposed that neither of the investigated furnaces was used for glass production.",

Holding time is considered as exponential function. Permanent allocation of VP is made by separate VP, where each of VPs enable transmitting offered laod with explicit bandwidth and explicit loss. The mathematic model was created to verify the above mentioned dependences for different types of telecomunications signals and different input flows. \"Comnet III\" software was selected for experimental verification of process optimization.

A network synthesis problem considered in this paper is to find a network G*n,e, that maximises system reliability over the class of all networks for the classes of networks Gn,n-1, Gn,m and Gn,n+1 respectively. In addition an upper bound of maximum reliability for the networks with n-node and e-edge (e>n+2) is derived in terms of node. Computational experiments for the reliability upper are also presented. the results show, that the proposed reliability upper bound is effective.",

		"Abstract": "Dynamic changes in traditional technologies and rising of new technologies call for development of new services. If service providers want to stay on information technologies market, they must keep track with this trend and adjust their services to customer requirements or develop new services. New applications will mainly depend on communication bandwidth and end users ability to handle it. If network providers will be able to ensure necessary bandwidth, there will be nothing that can stop service providers and developers in new service development. People know about growing necessity of new service and ask for them, but they hardly understand that the most important thing for service providers is merchantability and economic return of resources they gave to the developmentand implementation. By the lack of flexible development environment that is able to develop, test and provide final service for operation, new service development is not easy. There are different new service design procedures for various technological and user areas. This is the reason why this paper provides brief description of new service development procedure from technological and administrative point of view.",

		"Abstract": "A novel approach to the control of plants with model order uncertainty as well as parametric errors and externaldisturbances is presented, which yields a specified settling time of the step response with zero overshoot. The method is applied to amotion control system employing a permanent magnet synchronous motor. A single controller is designed to cater for mechanicalloads that may exhibit significant vibration modes. The order of the complete controlled system (i.e., the plant) will therefore dependon the number of significant vibration modes. The controller is of the cascade structure, comprising an inner drive speed control loopand an outer position control loop. The main contribution of the paper is a completely new robust control strategy for plants withmodel order uncertainty, which is used in the outer position control loop. Its foundations lie in sliding mode control, but the set ofoutput derivatives fed back extend to a maximum order depending on the maximum likely rank of the plant, rather than its knownrank. In cases where the maximum order of output derivative exceeds the plant rank, in theory, virtual states are created that raise theorder of the closed-loop system while retaining the extreme robustness properties of sliding mode control.",

Current pulses from a charge calibrator were injected into different parts of winding and both the distortion of the charge and their deformations at the end terminals were observed andevaluated. It was confirmed that the apparent charge of a partial discharge, as a diagnostic parameter, is not relatively verysensitive, comparing to other diagnostic parameters, e.g. to the size or the shape of a partial discharge current pulse. The charge of the partial discharge current pulse on terminals was integrated by means of three different methods. It was foundthat the attenuation of the partial discharge pulse is significant. It was confirmed by all three evaluating methods with similarresults. Furthermore, a measurement both of the attenuation of pulse and changes of partial discharge charge was realized ondifferent types of winding. It resulted in the fact that the attenuation of the partial discharge charge on different types of windingdepends on the winding parameters.",

		"Abstract": "Most advances manufactoring processes require precise linear motion for several tasks as material transfer, packaging, assembly or electrical wiring. To achieve precise linear  motion, most of the usual high-performance manufactoring machines use X-Y sliding tables with rotary motors and rotary - to - linear couplers. Though this method is the most widely used, it has disadvantages of low ccuracy, complex mechanical adjustments, hogh cost, and low reliability. This paper describes a novel modular construction which can be used to build up linear surface direct - driven motors for high performance motions in flexible manufactoring automation. The proposed motors have simple modular structure and they have no limitation on the travel distance. Simulated results of the linear and planar motion systems indicate that the motion systems has good accurancy.",

		"Abstract": "The increase of energy costs underlines the need to use more efficient drive systems. One of the best solutions to reduce energy costs is the use of variable speed drives. They can easily match motor torque and speed to the load, saving energy when load requirements are reduced. In almost all the cases in a variable speed drive system the motor is fed by a variable frequency electronics power converter. In the last years a tendency of integrating the motor and the frequency converter into a single unit could be observed. A prototype of such a compact variable drive system with a synchronous variable reluctance motor will be presented in this paper.",

Using a new particular transform theory the ordinary single-phase system can be transformed into equivalent two-axis orthogonal one. The new original thought is based on the idea that ordinary single-phase quantily can be complemented by fictious second phase so that both of them will create orthogonal system, as it usual in three-phase systems. Application of the above theory makes this possible to use complex methods of analysis as instantaneous reactive power method, which have not been usable for single-phase systems so far. All types of the power, active and reactive, can be determined by this way.",

Their faults and failures can lead to excessive downtimes and generate enormous costs in reduced output, emergency maintenance and lost revenues. Therefore the detection methods of electrical machines are of real interest. For the rotor faults diagnosis of induction machines one of the most widely used methods is the so-called motor current signature analysis (MCSA). This method can be applied both to the squirrel-cage and to the wound rotor induction motors. For current measurements and a data processing virtual instruments are proposed. In this paper some results obtained in the case of the wound rotor induction machine will be presented.",

		"Abstract": "A new diagnostic method (MAT - Magnetic Adaptive Testing) for non-destructive testing of ferromagnetic construction materials (i.e. iron based) under mechanical stress is under development, [1]. The method is based on the investigation of the correlation between the mechanical load and the parameters of Preisach-like model describing magnetic properties of such materials as the differential permeability matrix. To get the set of model parameters needed, a number of minor hysteresis loops under defined exciting magnetic field strength waveform shape H(t), especially with constant field change rate dH(t)/dt required (which implies the inducted voltage to be proportional to the differential permeability), is to be measured. The influence of initial magnetic state of the investigated material, algorithm of demagnetisation process, the slope of time dependence of exciting magnetic field on the signal-to-noise ratio and stability of the measured signal is discussed.",

		"Abstract": "Testing of magnetic properties of amorphous and nanocrystaline materials at AC magnetization represents very complicated problem of open specimen homogeneous magnetizing with the exactly defined magnetic flux waveform, the precise conversion of magnetic variables to the electrical ones and the measurement of integral values of strongly distorted electrical variables. Difficulties of these measurements are increasing with increasing frequency. The new Single Sheet Tester (SST) for open specimen magnetic measurement up to frequency 20 kHz has been developed at CTU in Prague, Dept. of circuit Theory. The new SST consists from the yoke with MMF compensation, and the power amplifier for excitation up to magnitude 100 V and currents up to 3 A at frequencies from 1 kHz to 20 kHz. The control and measuring system is completely digitalized and the core of it is based on PC plug-in cards. The paper presents the basic ideas of SST design and the first practical experience with the realized SST prototype.",

		"Abstract": "Wireless microwave systems tend to have high availability figures, but at the expense of the ability to operate at higher data rates. A quality of free space communication depends on atmospheric conditions. It is shown that microwave attenuation reacts sensitively on changes of changes of hydrometeor size distribution. However, a signal transmission is also significantly affected by both, refractive index and shape of hydrometeors. Non-spherical particles attenuate radiation at frequencies higher than about 200 GHz more effectively than volume equivalent spheres. On the other hand, the non-spherical ice phase hydrometeors form weakly attenuating media at v < 150 GHz. The quality of microwave signal transmission thought icy cloud is therefore much better as when the communication path is realized through rainy atmosphere (the particle sizes are assumed to be the same in both cases).",

We therefore folded the propagation path of the SAW in order to make better use of the total chip length. Using two slightly inclined reflectors to a Z-shaped filter which conserves the temperature stability of the quartz substrate. At a center frequency of 45 MHz we developed filter on small chips with good pass band characteristics and an insertion filters better than 10 dB.

		"Abstract": "The paper considers instantaneous processes in electrical circuits produced by the stepwise change of the capacitance of the capacitor and the inductance of the inductor and by the switching on and switching off of the circuit. In order to determine the set of electrical circuits, for which it is possible to explicitly obtain the values of the currents and the voltages at the end of the instantaneous process, a classification of the networks with nonlinear elements is introduced in the paper. The instantaneous switching process in the moment t0 is approximated when T->t0 with a sequence of processes in the interval [t0, T]. For quasi-linear inductive and capacitive circuits; we present the type of the system satisfied by the currents and the voltages, the charges, as well as the fluxes in the interval [t0, T]. From this system, after passage to the limit T->t0, we obtain the formulas for the values of the circuits at the end of the instantaneous process. The obtained results are applied for the analysis of particular processes.",

		"Abstract": "The importance of simple mechanical switches in rehabilitation cannot be overstated, particularly in the facilitation of communication and control by people with profound physical disabilities. Many communication and control systems are designed to be operable using a single switch (or a small number of switches). A crucial step in the tailoring of a system to a patient who will operate it in this way is the selection of an appropriate switch, according to their physical abilities. We present a prototype switch simulator, capable of reproducing various types of switching action under computer control. This electromechanical device exhibits a force versus displacement characteristic (possibly incorporating hysteresis) selected by the user on the PC. In this way, the suitability of a variety of switching actions for a patient can be assessed, and the optimal choice identified. Furthermore, for patients with very particular needs, this device can implement switching actions which are difficult or impossible to reproduce in a passive mechanical switch.",

		"Abstract": "In our work with disabled children at Ireland's National Rehabilitation Hospital, a problem we have experienced in the facilitation of art activities is that traditional art materials and standard computer drawing programs sometimes prove inaccessible. In this paper, an original system, called \"PaintMyVoice\" is presented which facilitates the creation of two or three-dimensional images using a variety of novel input modalities. In particular, vocalisations can be used to create original images of a variety of objects, including trees, flowers and landscape elements. Additional input to the system can optionally be provided via mouse, keyboard, switch interface or digital camera depending on the abilities of the user. Here, the program' user interface is described, with an emphasis on accessibility features.

In measuring pressure we devised a system of air-filled sacks interfaced with a PC. Each sack, placed under a particular key point on the body, is inflated until its faces just begin to separate and a switch thereby opens. The pressure reading is then captured and displayed by the computer. Seeking a noninvasive method of measuring the curvature of the vertebral columm, we discovered that we could use a magnetometer to measure the vertical displacement of magnetically-tagged verbrae from a fixed horizontal plane. The results of our study will be employed by an independent body to determine the metrits or demerit of the spinal raft.",

		"Abstract": "The contribution deals with the modelling and simulation of human brain haemodynamics using analogous electromagnetic systems characteristic especially propagation properties of distributed parameters circuits. The cascade connection of analogical transmission line elements represents the vascular tree both from the point of the parameters and the topology as well. In the paper there are presented simulation examples of the healthy cerebral system mainly in the big arteries in comparing with the pathologically changed ones. The various degrees of stenosis are considered for the simulations of blood pressure and blood flow velocity and the results are compared with the healthy arteries. According to the last investigations the pathological deformations of brain arteries are th most frequently reasons of deaths in the world. The stenoses or aneurysms change the physical properties of arteries and they follow insufficient vascularisation of the brain. These computer-aided non-invasive methods together with the non-invasive experimental techniques represent a helpful tool both for the diagnostics and the treatment of vascular pathological deformations.",

The apparatus for measurement of the signal proportional to the absolute value of scattering parameter S11 (reflexion coefficient) is described and the dependence of measured reflected signal on a bias magnetic field has been studied. By means of experiments, the resonances to be connected with the geometry of microwave experimental set-up were distinguished from ferromagnetic resonance arising in ferrite particles of composite structure. The role of local interaction fields of ferrite particles in composite material has been discussed.",

The experimental and theoretical curves of the complex permeability were compared. The contribution of both domain wall motion and spin rotational mangetisation processes on th complex permeability in high-frequency region (up to 1 GHz) is discussed. In the case of composite materials, the simple magnetic circuit approach is taken into account. In composites, the real part of the complex permeability in the frequency region above 100 MHz is larger than that of the prepared sintered ferrite. This is attibuted to the shift of the spin and domain wall resonance frequencies toward the higher frequency region by introducing demagnetising fields of magnetic particles in the composite.",

Such record behaves as a phase diffraction grating. The time dependence of diffracted beam intensity informs about process of the record creation. To read this record a weak beam of He-Ne laser (632.8 nm) was used. During recording and erasure process of the record, the intensities of the zero and intensities of higher orders on both sides of reading beam were detected. Experimentally obtained time dependences of intensities of diffracted beams were compared with dependences following from diffraction integral integral for harmonic phase grating. Quite small differences between measured and calculated dependences occurred. The differences show that there are some non-linear processes taking place at the record creation.",

		"Abstract": "The transmission function of twin core fibre is determined by his fibre length and coupling length if only one of its cores is excited. For design of attenuation components or sensors it is useful known transmission dependence twin core fibres on coupling length variations, because the coupling length depends on difference of effective propagation phase constants appertaining to particular fibre cores. It is possible to change tham by such deformation, which influences the difference of effective phase constants. For this purpose twin core fibres with one core in the centre of fibre are applicable. The simple deformation of fibre in torsion changes the length (and also effective propagation phase constant) of core located out of centre of fibre. The measuring dependencies of the influence of torsion on transmission functions for different values of twist make possible ease interpretation. Their agreement (or disagreement) with description following from theory may be possible indication of eventual misalignment of cores what is important for design of attenuation components with control attenuation or sensors.",

		"Abstract": "High quality silicon epitaxial layers are inevitable in bipolar and/or unipolar technology. However, its properties are not as easy characterized as those of bulk material. The recombination lifetime is dominated by surface/interface recombination for thin layers, which epitaxial ones generally are. We have designed diode structure with n+n/p+and \u00a0p+p/n+ epitaxial layer for open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) technigue. In such a structure, injected carriers are constrained within lightly doped base by potential barriers of junction and high-low contact and their concentration can then decrease only by recombination. Carrier lifetime obtained by this manner yields information mainly about the defect properties of epitaxial layer. Performing OCVD measurement for high-level injection condition, also tn and tp could be evaluated.",

For evaluating exists a semi empiric formula, that has a delimited relevance to small power range up to 50 kWatts of output power.

		"Abstract": "The tariff policy of a telecommunication operator has a strategic importance on achieving of optimal revenues and a fundamental impact on its position in the competition with another operators on the liberalised telecommunication market. The payment for a connection through a telecommunication network is determined by a rate for one call unit, by the duration of the call unit and their count during a call. An operator derives the rate and the duration of the call unit from a detailed analysis of large databases that contain statistical data on counts and duration of particular calls depending on the call type. Only the operator knows these data files and it keeps them confidential. It will be shown in the paper how it is possible to come to an estimation of revenues from telecommunication traffic only knowing a pair of basic parameters. The first considerations handling with this topic can be found in [1], [2],[3].",

		"Abstract": "The technological interest in fast ionic conductivity in glassy materials is increased in last years for various solid state electrochemical devices such as solid-state batteries, electrochronic displays, and sensors. The ion conductive glasses have several advantages comparing with crystalline materials because of their easy preparation, their stability, the large available compositionranges and reasonable cost. It is known that the investigation of conductivity spectra of ionic glasses can reflect the basic features ofthe relaxation and transport mechanisms of the mobile ions and the high ion conductivity at room temperature is the most important criterion which should be meet the fast ion conductive glasses. However, the relaxation and transport mechanisms can be investigated also by acoustic methods, that can have some advantages comparing to electrical ones as the high sensitivity, absence of contact phenomena and so on.In the contribution we present some electrical and acoustical properties of glasses prepared in the system CuI-CuBr-Cu20-(P20j+Mo03). The main purpose of the contribution is to contribute to the investigation of ion transport mechanisms in these fast ion conductive glasses and to determine the relation between electrical and acoustical properties considering the various glass compositions.",

As the receptors offield are not known (e.g. inputs of EMF into organism), its effects are judged only by non-specific reaction of organism. With high frequencyand microwave fields are relatively the most clarified thermal effects, but effect of EMF mobile phones on central nervous system, cardio-vascular, blood and immune system are ascribed to non-thermal effects, e.g. longer standing exposures of fields with relative low power level.

		"Abstract": "The contribution presents an extension of indirect vector control of electric drives employing induction motors to 'Forced Dynamic Control'. This method of control offers an accurate realisation of dynamic response profiles, which can be selected by the user. The developed system can be integrated into a drive with a shaft position encoder or a shaft sensoriess drive, in which only the stator currents are measured. The applied stator voltages are determined by a computed inverter switching algorithm. Simulation results and preliminary experimental results for indirect vector control of an idle running induction motor indicate good agreement with the theoretical predictions.",

A microprocessor must scan and evaluate function of many controlled equipment that can be transformed into 2 statuses - \"free\" or \"busy\". Microprocessors in a digital exchange are the typical example of that. It can be said the microprocessors are in a discrete dialogue with the controlled parts. They ascertain in regular time intervals whether the status of the controlled equipment has changed. 1 or more \"busy\" statuses may exist in the same time. As the changes from \"free\" to \"busy\" and from \"busy\" to \"free\" occur randomly, the state of i busy statuses lasts for a random period too. If the changes have pro-perties of Markov process, the probability which each change will be detected with and hence the scanning rate needed can be derived.",

		"Abstract": "The paper deals with the modelling and simulation of physiological fluid systems, especially the human vascular system. The described procedures are based on the electron~echanical analogy making possible the application of electromagnetic theory. The physiological fluid segments are represented by the analogical equivalent electric transmission line sections. According to this analogy the electromagnetic propagation characteristics describe the mechanical properties of flowing fluids. The introduced modelling and simulation procedures enable to describe and visualize all states of dynamics of physiological processes, especially of the human haemodynamics. The obtained results serve as an important tool for non-invasive computer aided diagnostics.",
